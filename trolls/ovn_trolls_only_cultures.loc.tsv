cultures_frontend_description_ovn_troll	The Trolls have been a plague to the inhabitants of the world for ages, a race of large, stupid, lumbering and strong humanoids with a propensity to eat anything and everything. Their origin is unclear, some most scholars theorise they are creatures of Chaos, in the same way Manticores and Griffons are, yet some other fringe theories talk about them being a mutation of one of the primeval races of the world, before the coming of the Old Ones. Whatever the case, the Trolls themselves are too stupid to care about such things, with only a couple specimens being as smart as the average member of the civilised races, Throgg, the self-proclaimed King of All Trolls being the most infamous example. They are also known for their regenerative capabilities, and the weakness of these to fire, of which they're greatly scared. They are extremely adaptive, being able to live and thrive in most regions of the world. There exist many varieties of Troll, from the boulder-eating Stone Trolls to the frozen Ice Trolls of Norsca, all adapted in certain ways to their environment. They rarely form any sort of coherent settlements, usually being lonely creatures inhabiting caves, the underside of bridges or forests, but some of the more wilful and intelligent ones have known to have formed "tribes" that have some semblance of organisation. On the battlefield, the lumbering Trolls make extensive use of monstrous infantry, with a few chaff units and little to no ranged support. Their strength comes from various specialised kinds of monstrous infantry, from the resilient Stone Trolls to the flaming Lave Trolls. While their general lack of armour and low overall morale may hinder them, their legendary regenerative capabilities allow them to remain in the battlefield for a long time.	false
