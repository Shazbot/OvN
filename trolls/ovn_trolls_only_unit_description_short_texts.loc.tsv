unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_sea_hag	Sea Troll Hags are thankfully only rarely encountered outside their deep sea habitats. They wield the foul magic of the deep oceans against those who draw their ire.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_carrion_boss	Goblin Big Bosses of the Carrion Tribes are survivors, they are either clever enough to manipulate their rather dim troll overlords or just faster than their peers when running away.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_ovn_unit_short_text_trl_stone_throw_troll	These trolls are more than willing to throw their enemies a bone or two.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_carrion_gobbo_bow	Wandering goblins can sometimes be found trailing Troll tribes in hope of picking clean any discarded carcasses. Ugma pressed these gobbos into service and they make for good scouts and archers keeping scavengers away.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_carrion_gobbo_squig	The Goblins of the Carrion Tribe are largely ignored by the Trolls as long as they find enough food, something the squig hoppers have no difficulty in.  At any rate it's a much better deal than you'd get under an orc.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_carrion_gobbo	The number of goblins under Ugma's service grew so large he ordained them as the Carrion Tribe, with a new sense of belonging these outcasts gladly make up the chaff for Ugma's armies	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_night_trolls_ror	These terrifying creatures are similar in appearance to their kin the Stone Trolls but of a much darker complexion. They are attributed in myth to utter a deep guttural sound, akin to mocking laughter before they tear their prey to pieces."	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_armoured_icetrolls	Only under the influence of a powerful warrior will the mighty ice trolls of Norsca accept armour pieces on their bodies.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_red_avalanche	The strongest, biggest and most ferocious angry ice trolls you could find. After countless battles, the frozen blood of their enemies on their bodies gave them their red hue.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_river_trolls	Cavern Trolls are a subspecies of River Trolls who usually dwell in underground lakes and seas. They prey on the horrors of the deep and the occasional adventurer or Dwarf miner.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_mountain_trolls	Whether these trolls were originally normal Stone Trolls or maybe another Troll species entirely is unknown, but their skin has been hardened to a point that they barely receive damage and rarely feel any pain. If they are hurt though, their confidence is shaken easily.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_shipwreckers	Living in the polluted of Marienburg's sewers near the sea, these Cavern Trolls learned how to smash ships for food. 	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_cha_troll_lord	There is only one troll in existence that can really be called a leader.  Luckily a mix of mind control and savage punishment can produce trolls that can at least create the illusion of leadership.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_kin	These Trolls got named by surviving Kislevite soldiers because they have often been seen together with the Trollking. 	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_forest_trolls	Trolls that have somewhat adapted to the forest life. They are difficult to spot in forests when standing still, but at the same time simply don't comprehend the concept of sneaking.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_bile_trolls	Bile Trolls are descendants of a troll horde that once defeated and devoured a Nurgle Army. Infected by the Plaguefather's many gifts, they suffer horribly for it.	true

unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_lava_trolls	Lava Trolls are an oddity, originally hailing from the Dark Lands. It is unknown if they are a testament of the incredible adaptability of trolls to every environment or the result of a twisted experiment by the sinister inhabitants of these accursed lands.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_warpstone_trolls	Rumored to be either creations of Chaos or escaped Moulder experiments, the Warped Ones are growing warpstone from their body, appearently without suffering ill effects from it. They are seemingly immune to pain and will only run near death.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_sea_troll	Rarely can the elusive Shugon - Trolls of the Sea - be lured to leave their deep sea habitats and venture on land. The enormous pressure of the deep sea give them monstrous strength, even compared to other trolls.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_troll_champ	The existance of Troll champions can be seen as a proof for the humor of the dark gods or their cruelty. Or both.	true
unit_description_short_texts_text_elo_troll_giant	Sometimes, rarely, a seemingly normal troll never stops to grow. Scholars still debate possible reasons, but it is probably connected to the volatile, chaotic nature of troll biology.	true
