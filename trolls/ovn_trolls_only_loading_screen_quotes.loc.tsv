Rotgut, after forcing Gorgal to join his tribe, marched his warband to Karak Azgul. There deep within the hold, a long and bloody battle took place at the Dark Reservoir. Though piles of greenskins littered the embankments, Ugma was overwhelmed and forced to flee through one of the underground rivers feeding the reservoir. With his forces destroyed Umga looked beyond his homely borders and forced many southern tribes to submit to his will. This was all for one purpose, to retake Karak Azgul and smash Gorgal’s and Rotgut’s head in.	false
