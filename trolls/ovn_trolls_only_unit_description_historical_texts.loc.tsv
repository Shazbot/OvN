unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_troll_champ	No one knows for certain why the Ruinous Powers would choose dimwitted creatures such as Trolls to bear the mantle of Champion, but as it happens, there are multiple recorded examples of this. The Gods of Chaos have been known to twist and mutate their grotesque Chaos Troll servants not only into greater size and strength, but also into enhanced intelligence (for one of their race, at least). These Troll Champions, as they are known, are often the "leaders" of the Chaos Troll packs in the far north by virtue of being far stronger and somewhat more lucid, and, alongside their other mutations, they are also gifted a suit of Chaos Armour, fused to their skin, adding to their already formidable resilience. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_troll_giant	Once in a while, a Troll with a strange quirk is born. This quirk makes them never stop growing in size, often reaching the same heights as a giant, or even larger, depending on the particular Troll's nutrition. While one might think this would also make their brains, and with them their intelligence, grow, this couldn't be further from the truth. If anything, these gigantic specimens seem even more stupid and dimwitted than their smaller cousins. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_carrion_gobbo_bow	The Goblins of the Carrion Tribe, or Carrion Goblins as they are usually known, are a particular species of Goblin known for following Troll packs around and feasting on the carcasses and remains that the lumbering brutes leave behind. The smarter Troll chieftains will often take note of the natural cowardice of the Goblins, and intimidate them into serving as chaff troops in their armies. They will also often bring "offerings" in the form of carcasses and bodies of various creatures, in hopes of gaining the favour of their Troll masters, and of not being eaten themselves. They like to festoon themselves with the bones of their various creatures and victims, and fight like their common cousins, only armed with primitive clubs, bows and spears made of bone.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_carrion_gobbo_squig	The Goblins of the Carrion Tribe, or Carrion Goblins as they are usually known, are a particular species of Goblin known for following Troll packs around and feasting on the carcasses and remains that the lumbering brutes leave behind. The smarter Troll chieftains will often take note of the natural cowardice of the Goblins, and intimidate them into serving as chaff troops in their armies. Some have also been known to ride squigs into battle, in order to catch more and better food faster, in order to please their Troll masters.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_night_trolls_ror	These terrible creatures resemble their Stone Troll cousins, but have a considerably darker hue. These Trolls, dressed in ragged clothes and ornamented with the bones of their victims, seek the flesh of the living to feast on. They are said to make a loud guttural sound, similar to mocking laughter, before tearing their prey to pieces. If a creature happens to come upon a Night Troll, it seizes its victim with enormous brutish clawed hands, shouts a laugh, and rends its unlucky prey to shreds. It's unknown what environment or horrid mutation caused these malign creatures to be born, but some speculate they might be Stone Trolls who have come under the influence of Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure, hence the glee they take in lauging at their prey all the while they slowly devour them alive.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_chief_ugma	Chief Umga is one of the few Trolls gifted with extra-ordinary intelligence, much like Throgg, the self-proclaimed King of Trolls. It's unknown what caused this mutation, but the most likely cause is the fact that, as a runt, Umga was exposed to great amounts of warpstone, causing his body and mind to mutate in unpredictable ways. Umga is a River Troll, and has carved a small territory for himself in the ruins of the dwarfen hold of Karak Azgal, where he inhabits the underground lake the Dwarfs used as water reservoir, along with a tribe of fellow River Trolls, whom he often sends to capture adventurers and loot for riches. He has amassed a considerable wealth thanks to this, and recently he has started expanding his territory beyond Karak Azgal, going so far as bringing other Trolls under the influence of his tribe. Umga often likes to talk to his prey before devouring it. Its taste is made all the sweeter by the surprise in its eyes when it finds that a savage River Troll can speak with such fluency. Umga despises Orcs, who all too often like to keep his fellow Trolls as pets or slaves, and will often eat most of their race in the spot.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_warpstone_trolls	It is widely known that Stone Trolls will often eat rocks and gravel from their mountainous surroundings, and that this will cause them to grow thicker pelts. This particular pack of Stone Trolls comes from the mountains near the Warpstone Desert, a place known for its ubiquitious natural deposits of warpstone, and has taken to eating the foul ore, which has started in turn to expand and grow across the Trolls' craggy skin. Warpstone normally kills or horribly mutates anyone who ingests it, but thanks to the natural affinity with Chaos and the regenerative powers of the Troll, these specimens have effectively absorbed the cursed substance into their bodies, and now irradiate the same foul energies as the Warpstone itself, causing enemies to be blinded, become sickly, or mutated in their presence. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_armoured_icetrolls	These Ice Trolls have "taken a page" from the book of their Chaos Troll cousins and, in a great feat of intellegence, have started festooning themselves with the armours of warriors murdered and eaten by them. The cold that surrounds these creatures has permeated into the pieces of armour themselves, making them more resistant than they ought to be, for scavenged scrap metal.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_southern_trolls	With their nature bound to the ebbs and flows of Chaos, Trolls who inhabit areas further away from the Polar Gates and the influence of Chaos are often noticeably runtier and smaller than their cousins. They are often nicknamed "Southern Trolls", a name deriving mostly from the fact that they inhabit the regions of Nehekhara, Araby and parts of the Southlands, Trolls further south towards the southern polar gate tend to be much like their northernmost peers. Though noticeably weaker than any other breed of Troll, they are often more numerous, and even with the lessened influence of Chaos suffusing their bodies, they still possess the fearsome regenerative powers of their race.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_red_avalanche	The Red Avalanche are a particularly vicious pack of Ice Trolls, known for rampaging across the battlefield at the slightest provocation. It is said that they are favoured by Khorne, Lord oFSkulls. All the blood they have spilled in their countless battles and massacres has suffsed them to their very core, with the ice and snow covering their bodies having turned red from it, giving them their dreaded nickname.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_river_trolls	Cave Trolls are actually a subspecies of River Trolls, who tend to inhabit underground lakes, underground rivers, and other water reservoirs. They don't often come out of their lairs, for generations of living underground have adapted their eyes to low-light environments, but they have enough prey in the form of the occasional careless adventurer or Dwarfen miner. Having needed to adapt to the tighter confines of the watery caves they inhabit, Cave Trolls are slightly smaller than their river cousins, but not any less deadly. They will sometimes accompany some Troll tribes to war, if offered enough food and the promise of shiny loot to guard in their lairs.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_mountain_trolls	Believed to be a variant of Stone Trolls, further mutated by the corrupting influence of Chaos. The already craggy and rocky skins of the Stone Trolls have transformed further into stone, to the point that these creatures can easily ambush unwitting prey by staying still in their natural mountain habitats and pretending to be oddly shaped boulders or rocks. When their hard hide is pierced, they tend to quickly flee from the fight. They tend to live in the mountain ranges closest to the Chaos Wastes, such as the northernmost part of the World's Edge Mountains or the many mountain ranges of Norsca. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_shipwreckers	The Shipwrecks are a particular band of Cave Trolls who have made their home in parts of Marienburg's extensive sewers. They usually come out of their sewer lair during the night, breaking with their mauls the hulls of the ships moored in Marienburg's docks to steal all their treasures and eat any of the crew that might be sleeping in or standing watch over the ship. Some unscrupulous pirates, mostly followers of the dread shark god Stromfels, have "hired" the Shipwreckers in order to enact many of these sinkings, for it pleases the Wrecker-God. After being hired too many times, and as Trolls tend to do, they have picked up the idiosyncrasies of their surroundings, and have started dressing in the style of Sartosan pirates.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_cha_troll_lord	Though the number of Troll specimens that are truly intelligent can be counted with one hand's fingers (amongst them, King Throgg and Chief Ugma), some other Trolls have managed to have a sort of higher cunning or lesser intelligence, depending on who you ask. Be it through the result of mutation, magical experiments, or some form of mind control, these Troll Chiefs have created an illusion of authority around them, real enough to fool the more commonly dim members of their race into following them as leaders. How they lead tends to vary, but most do certainly behave with more foresight than the average Trolls, coordinating the attacks of the tribe and organising what passes for Troll settlements. In any case, they also tend to be the biggest and strongest members of the tribe as well, so where "intelligence" fails, they resort to pure brute strength. They loot the best armour for themselves, and might even have the prescience to keep some Human or Dwarf smiths as slaves around to make them custom sets of armour instead of just eating them. For better or worse, these are some of the brightest specimens of the Troll race.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_kin	Throgg's Company is a pack of Ice Trolls that always accompany the Troll King himself to battle. Due to their extreme similarity in behaviour and appearance ( though fortunately, not in intelligence ), they are rumoured to be the children of Throgg himself. There's, of course, no way to confirm these rumours, for anybody approaching the Troll King is likely not going to do so to confirm gossip. Whatever the case, they are extremely fierce in battle and loyal only to Throgg. The Kislevites in particular hold great fear for these Ice Trolls, not only for their ferocity in combat, but also because wherever they are, Throgg himself goes, and where the Troll King goes, the doom of Man follows.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_forest_trolls	Forest Trolls are a breed of Troll that has adapted to life in the deepest woods of the Old World. While at first glance, it might seem that clumsy and lumbering creatures such as Trolls might have problems navigating and surviving in such an environment, the truth is that they have adjusted to their home quite well. The various plants that surround their bodies are not some sort of primitive camouflage ( Trolls are not smart enough to understand the concept of camouflage ), but rather a result of their extended exposure to foresty areas, which has resulted in plants growing and thriving on their bodies, forming a symbiotic relationship with the Troll, who, in turn, uses them to inadvertently ambush their hapless prey, for when they stay still, they are undistingusable from the rest of the thick forest they make their lairs in. Some also wear strange masks into battle, though nobody is really sure why they do so, Trolls passively pick up idyosincrasies, so some scholars theorise they are imitating some of the forest dwelling cultures, such as Forest Goblins or Wood Elves.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_bile_trolls	Bile Trolls are probably one of, if not the most, grotesque subspecies of Troll to exist. They are descended from the tribe of an ancient Troll Chieftain who, after defeating a warband of Nurgle's servants, decided to feast on their diseased flesh. This resulted in all the poxes, cankers, and maladies inhabiting the flesh of Nurgle's followers infecting the Trolls, with not even their infamous regenerative powers able to keep up with the poisons spreading through their bodies. Though ever adapable, though, these Trolls survived and became twisted things, in constant agony due to their constantly rotting and regenerating bodies. Unlike most of the Plaguefather's creatures, these beasts find no merriment in their curse, forever cursed with both agonising pain and gnawing hunger. Mercifully, they are few in number, and mostly inhabit the regions of the Troll Country nearest to the Chaos Wastes. Their regenerative powers are severely diminished due to having to keep up with their diseased bodies, but the putrid bile that flows from their wounds, a mix of Nurgle's concoctions and the corrosive acid that is the Troll's stomach fluids, is known to instantly rot any flesh it touches.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_snow_troll	Snow Trolls are a subspecies of the Ice Troll who have adapted to live on the highest peaks and the longest mountain ranges. They are extremely solitary creatures, even for Trolls, living in solitary caves near mountain peaks and preying on anyone and anything foolish enough to stray into the mountains. They are often confused with the fabled Yhetees that inhabit the Mountains of Mourn, but while Yhetees are fast and deadly creatures with high cunning, Snow Trolls are as dimwitted and slow as any other troll, though nobody close enough to them cares, because both are terribly deadly creatures. They normally adorn their caves with the bones of their prey, and their thick furry hides protect them from even the hardest attacks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_sea_hag	Much like their Rivel Troll cousins, the Sea Troll Hags are horrid creatures, probably even more so than the River variety. These ugly creatures share the same fish-like head and bloated body of their Sea Troll kin, and usually coordinate packs of Sea Troll, behaving in a much more "motherly" way towards their children than the River Troll Hags do towards their normal counterparts. These creatures can manipulate the Winds of Magic, which they use to bend the powers of the ocean to their will. It is said that they worship Stromfels devoutly and believe him to be the father of the Sea Trolls. What this means exactly is unknown, but the truth of it is that Sea Troll Hags will often be surrounded by large tribes of Sea Trolls, mostly her cubs, who will come to the aid of their dear mothers at their beck and call.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_carrion_boss	The Chiefs of the Carrion Goblins are either the most cunning of the tribe, able to convince their comparatively dim-witted Troll overlords that they are the right choice to lead their kin, or just the quickest, able to outrun and elude the Trolls when they decide that it's time to eat their erstwhile allies. Either way, they are the most able of the Carrion tribe, as sneaky and cunning as any other Goblin boss ought to be. They are known to frequently ride squigs to battle, and outside of battle too, to better outrun the occasional hungry Troll.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_carrion_boss_squig	The Chiefs of the Carrion Goblins are either the most cunning of the tribe, able to convince their comparatively dim-witted Troll overlords that they are the right choice to lead their kin, or just the quickest, able to outrun and elude the Trolls when they decide that it's time to eat their erstwhile allies. Either way, they are the most able of the Carrion tribe, as sneaky and cunning as any other Goblin boss ought to be. They are known to frequently ride squigs to battle, and outside of battle too, to better outrun the occasional hungry Troll.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_carrion_squig_hoppers	The Goblins of the Carrion Tribe, or Carrion Goblins as they are usually known, are a particular species of Goblin known for following Troll packs around and feasting on the carcasses and remains that the lumbering brutes leave behind. The smarter Troll chieftains will often take note of the natural cowardice of the Goblins, and intimidate them into serving as chaff troops in their armies. Some have also been known to ride squigs into battle, in order to catch more and better food faster, in order to please their Troll masters.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_carrion_gobbo_melee	The Goblins of the Carrion Tribe, or Carrion Goblins as they are usually known, are a particular species of Goblin known for following Troll packs around and feasting on the carcasses and remains that the lumbering brutes leave behind.

Some have also been known to ride squigs into battle, in order to catch more and better food faster, in order to please their Troll masters.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_trl_inf_stone_throw_troll	These particularly bright Trolls have had the brightest of ideas: throwing the bones of the creatures and people they have eaten at the enemy. While most Trolls would consider it a waste of good food ( if Trolls do ever consider anything ), these Trolls have figured out that this way, they'll get even more food in the end, which is truly a titanic breakthrough when it comes to the Troll mind. The bones also have the added advantage of discouraging enemy troops, since a lot of the bones tend to belong to their fallen ( and eaten ) comrades.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_lava_trolls	Perhaps one of the most curious breeds of Troll, the Lava Trolls hail from the Dark Lands, a land of perpetual heat, constantly active volcanoes, and flowing lava. Amazingly enough, these Trolls managed to adapt to life here, with the downside of losing their regenerative abilities. The heat and lava in the ambient have come to suffuse their bodies, and now they project an aura of blistering heat, grievously burning those that stay around them long enough. Even the Troll's famed stomach acids have turned into a more fiery substance, with Lava Trolls using it to burn flesh and melt armour. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_sea_troll	Sea Trolls, or Shugons as they are often known, are a strange breed of Troll that inhabits the deep seas of the world. These creatures have managed to thrive and survive on the ocean's sea floor, feeding off other sea predators and occasionally swimming up to the surface to crack open ships to eat their occupants or to assault shore settlements on islands. They are the ultimate proof of Troll adaptabilitiy. The shape of their heads differs much from the typical troll, resembling more a horrid fishlike creature. This is said to be the result of their connection to Stromfels, the Shark God.	true
