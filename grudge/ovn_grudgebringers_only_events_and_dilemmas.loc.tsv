dilemmas_localised_description_ovn_dilemma_sabaar_occupy	Beneath one of the many temples of Ka-Sabaar, deep down its spiral stairs it a plain font within a simple stone chamber is discovered. It held a liquid the colour of snow and just as cold, which glistened under torchlight.\\n\\nThe locals spoke of its healing properties, and after it miraculously saved our dying troops the whole army sipped from the ‘Fountain of Light’ feeling rejuvenated.

The Imperial Engineer warns there isn’t time to defuse the system and shot nor steel can break the magically reinforced glass.\\n\\nTo the front of the Vats are four buttons each bearing a sigil of some imperial magical orders. Beneath these there is a small inscription ‘Every monster has its weakness’. The Commander dabs his brow as his finger trembles over the sigils.	true

event_feed_strings_text_wh_event_feed_string_scripted_event_grudge_rescue_secondary_detail	After our victory at Morgheim we ventured deep into its bowels in search of our missing troops. Within the labyrinth of dungeons we found too few  –  bloodied and beaten at the hands of their captors – a necromancer and a dimwitted hunchback. Those that could, uttered unspeakable horrors,  and from their mumblings we discovered a secret chamber. It was strewn with morbid contraptions, a bloodstained altar taking centrepiece. Atop this ghastly altar sat a jet black orb with an impossible iridescent glow that waxed and waned. As our men neared they spoke of dark thoughts and an unshakeable dread.\\n\\nNot all we sent emerged from Morgheim’s hellish depths and those that did, did so confused, trembling with no account of their time. We sealed the entrances to the cursed under-lairs, may Sigmar forgive us, as we pray that our lost brothers receive the swift mercy of Morr.\\n\\n[[img:bullet_emp_units]][[/img]][[col:ancillary_unique]] Rescued 2 RoR[[/col]]\\n[[img:icon_effect_wizard]][[/img]][[col:ancillary_unique]] Gained the ‘Orb of Chalcidar’[[/col]]	true

event_feed_strings_text_wh_event_feed_string_scripted_event_grudge_start_two_secondary_detail	The dwarf Azguz Bloodfist and his throng are heartily welcomed into camp. After pleasantries are exchanged the two commanders retire to Bernhardt's pavilion. The dwarf sensibly started his tale from the beginning. His Dawi brothers were sent to track and apprehend a lone Elgi travelling south along the Worlds Edge Mountains but it was they who were set upon like prey. They were sent to find their lost brothers and from the battlefield found markers that led all the way to Morgheim. Knowing Bernhardt had lost his own men not days ago he propositioned they join forces and free their kin. He warned that Morgheim was no mere ruin it had been rebuilt into a looming fortress and they would need more troops if they we’re to storm the necropolis.\\n\\n[[img:bullet_emp_units]][[/img]][[col:ancillary_unique]] Joined by Azguz Bloodfist[[/col]]\\n	true

Though one still clung to life, Sergeant Schepke rushed over to cut them down before they beckoned Bernhardt. Bloodied and wilting, he still recognised his friend the elven ranger Ceridan. This was the elf the dwarfs had been tracking through the mountains. After some much-needed rest, Bernhardt inquired of the elf why he traveled so far south. Ceridan looked Bernhardt in the eyes, he is not the only one would not see the world turn to ruin the Dread King must be stopped at all costs. The elf went on to speak of the ancient city of Ka-Sabaar, and how deep beneath its towering temples lay the key to life ‘the fountain of light’. Though this gift could restore the Dread Kings terrible power and it was imperative that they destroy it.\\n\\n[[img:bullet_emp_units]][[/img]][[col:ancillary_unique]] Rescued Ceridan the Lone Ranger[[/col]]\\n	true

This however only hastens the others which quickly turn to a dark opaque green. Flashes and bangs can be made out from inside before it all goes silent.
