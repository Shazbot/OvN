morgan_bernhardt_unit_commander_name	Morgan Bernhardt	false
morgan_bernhardt_unit_description	Bernhardt is the eldest son of Graf Bernhardt of Nuln. His father is a wealthy and influential merchant, who controls the traffic over five bridges, including the Great Drawbridge over the Reik. As per tradition in Nuln, wealthy families send their eldest sons to the Officer Academy of the great Gunnery School. Bernhardt spent four years learning and gained a reputation as a gifted but troublesome student, graduating at the top of every class he bothered to attend. He was attracted to the glamour of the Cavalry and was known to outride the Reikguard Knights who visited at times. However, he was eventually expelled from the academy for gross insubordination, duelling, and misappropriation of college funds. Bernhardt attempted to join the Knightly orders, but all refused him due to his checkered history. He was even denied a place in the Empire Pistoliers. Despite this setback, Bernhardt now leads the famed mercenary army, the Grudgebringers, named after the magical sword wielded by Bernhardt himself. This mighty blade was forged by the Dwarfs and inscribed with magic runes by a Bright Wizard. The sword was gifted to a young Bernhardt in a supposed chance meeting at the alehouse, the Kippered Herring. An ageing Arch Wizard, Darius Redhand III of the Bright College in Altdorf, saw potential in this upstart and knowing his sword's unquenchable thirst for battle bequeathed it to Morgan.	false

grudgebringer_cavalry_unit_description	So named after their captain's powerful sword 'Grudgebringer' these mercenaries already command an unsullied respect on their home turf in Reikland. The Grudgebringers have since marched to the troubled Border Princes where they quest for a major campaign to prove themselves worthy of greater fortunes. These mercenary cavalry form the core of the army known as the Grudgebringers. Klaus Zimmerman serves as mentor to Bernhardt and the two men have known each other for some time.

The name came from a now-famous battle at Black Fire Pass when they held off two hundred orcs for hours while the baggage train they guarded retreated into the safety of the Empire. Only sixteen of the initial fifty survived, but every goblin was slain to the last. The mercenaries explained their suicidal defense of the convoy simply by the fact that theirs was a fixed-sum contract, and the money due for fifty now went to a mere sixteen. Not only that, but the gold to pay the mercenaries rested in the rearmost wagons of the convoy - a shrewd move by the convoy's paymaster.	false
