cultures_frontend_description_ovn_albion	Shrouded in an impenetrable magical mist, far off the western coast of Norsca lies the island of Albion. Chosen by the Old Ones in ancient times to be one of their strongholds, Albion is now ruled by the Truthsayers, an ancient order of Human mystics who rule over the primitive tribals of the island. The Men of Albion have been led by the Truthsayers since the Great Cataclysm, rarely venturing outside their shrouded island, but valiantly defending it from those that managed to pierce the shroud, fighting with fierce determination against the servants of the Ruinous Powers and the curruptiing nature of Chaos, always trying to seep into their homeland. The hosts of Albion are heavily geared towards offensive melee combat, with little ranged options, fast cavalry and a variety of monstruous units. Most Human troops are protected by magical Woad Paint, providing some missile resistance when the Winds of Magic are high. Most Albion units also descend  into a War Fury when in melee, but, except for the most elite units, this lack of professonalism means that they will be quicker to flee battlee when it turns against them.	false
