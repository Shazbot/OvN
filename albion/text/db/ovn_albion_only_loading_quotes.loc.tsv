loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_alb_duraldurak_loading		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_alb_duraldurak_loading	Dural Durak is the leader of the Truthsayers, an ancient order of warrior sorcerers who have protected the secrets of the Old Ones in Albion for generations. Young and impetuous, where other Truthsayers would advise caution and isolation, Dural actively fights the influence of Chaos and Be'lakor on his island. He won't rest until the Ogham Stones have been restored and Albion has been aligned with the plan of the Old Ones.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_alb_mhorrinion_loading	Mhorriníon, the Murder Queen	true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_alb_mhorrinion_loading		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_alb_mhorrinion_loading	An enigmatic and powerful figure, even her true name is unknown, Mhorriníon only means "Daughter of Mhorr" in the native tongue of Albion. She is fierce and passionate, and boldly claims Albion as her own. The recent invasion and despoiling of the land of Albion by the Forces of Chaos and the Dark Master has sent her into a  vengeful rage, and she has raised a host of her most loyal followers in Albion to scour the Chaos Wastes of all of its accursed inhabitants, be they mortal or daemonic.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_alb_centaur_loading	Centaurs	true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_alb_centaur_loading		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_alb_centaur_loading	The Centaurs were created by the Old Ones with the purpose of guarding their sites of power in the island of Albion. Half-man, half-horse, these noble beings have little in common with the rowdy and crass Centigors beyond their similar appearances. When the land of Albion is threatened, they have been known to hear the summons of the Truthsayers and lend their strength to the hosts of Albion, armed with axes and ornate bronze armour.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_alb_chariot_loading	Albion War Chariot	true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_alb_chariot_loading		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_alb_chariot_loading	The natives of Albion are surprisingly skilled at building and riding battle chariots. On top of chariots, the Albionese fight by striking with sharp spears from atop and using the momentum generated by their speed to charge into enemy formations and disrupt them.﻿	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_campaign_alb_albion	Albion	true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_campaign_alb_albion		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_campaign_alb_albion	The natives of Albion are considered crude and primitive by the rest of the Old World, but on their shoulders rests the duty of defending their island—the ancient capital of the Old Ones—from the predations of those ignorant enough to plunder its sacred sites and from the ever-present influence of the Ruinous Powers. Brutal in melee combat and led by the mystical Truthsayers, the hosts of Albion are formed by strong and proud barbarians covered in magical woad, elemental guardians of the bogs of Albion known as Fenbeasts, Giants, Centaurs, and many other fearsome monsters.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_albion_lore_1		true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_albion_lore_1		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_albion_lore_1	"Now you have no army or Dark Master to protect you, evil servant of darkness. I am the one they call Dural Durak, leader of the Truthsayers, and I command you to leave my island or I will be forced to contaminate this sacred land with your tainted blood."\\n\\n- Dural Durak to the Dark Emissary Kh'nar at the Battle of Ohbuhu	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_albion_lore_2		true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_albion_lore_2		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_albion_lore_2	"The weather is always bad in Albion but recently it has seemed particularly so. Great storms lash the lands. Rivers flood. Villages are swept away. A great curse has settled on our land, Teclis of Ulthuan. First the greenskins descended from the mountains in their hordes and then all of the things you have described have happened. Some say the Gods of Light have turned their faces from Albion and that they watch over us no longer."\\n\\n- Murdo Mac Baldoch, Truthsayer of Albion to High Loremaster Teclis	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_albion_lore_3		true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_albion_lore_3		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_albion_lore_3	The Ogham Circles that dot Albion are not mere primitive constructions or simple markers for the tombs of ancient kings, but rather, much like the Elven Waystones, they channel the excess magic from the polar gates into the Great Vortex. The Old Ones gave the Truthsayers of Albion the secrets to build and maintain these circles, as well as the task to defend them until the last of their kind. They aren't alone in this task, for the Old Ones also put all manner of creatures as guardians of these sites, the noble Centaurs, the dimwitted Giants, the brutish Aitheach, and other kinds of deadly wardens.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_albion_lore_4		true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_albion_lore_4		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_albion_lore_4	The Giants of Albion, while similar in appearance to their continental cousins, are fanatically loyal to the cause of the Truthsayer, aiding them in aligning the Ogham Circles of Albion in accordance with the Plan of the Old Ones, and marching with them to battle when it is necessary.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_albion_lore_5		true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_albion_lore_5		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_albion_lore_5	No one for sure knows the origin of the Aitheach, or Giant-Blooded, as they are known by the natives of Albion. Theories and legends about them are abundant, from them being the product of the union of Man and Giant, to them being distant cousins to the Ogres of the Mountains of Mourn, to being a lost kin to Mankind. No one knows for certain, except the Aitheach themselves, who are reclusive and reserved, and the Truthsayers, who have vowed never to reveal any of the secrets of Albion unless absolutely necessary.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_albion_lore_6		true
loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_albion_lore_6		true
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_albion_lore_6	Many people in the Old World imagine Albion's natives as crude mud hut dwellers who speak a gluttural language and dress in primitive furs. This is quite far from the truth, their society, while not nearly as advanced as the Empire, follows a rigid code of laws, and they are known to build simple yet efficient chariots and catapults. No inhabitant of Albion proves this more than the Truthsayers protectors of the legacy of the Old Ones, who are privy to many secrets about the enigmatic worldshapers than even the highest Loremasters of Ulthuan.	true
loading_screen_quotes_title_ovn_game_hint_lore_of_truthsayers_unit	Lore of the Truthsayers	true

loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_game_hint_lore_of_truthsayers_unit	The Truthsayers of Albion practise a unique kind of magic, derived from the ancient knowledge of the Winds given to them by the Old Ones.	true
