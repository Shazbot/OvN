unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_albion_warriors_spears	When their tribe goes to war, the most able-bodied Albionites in it form warbands, which battle passionately to defend their homeland under their Chieftains or Overkings. While the common tribal folk of Albion are not professional fighters, continual inter-tribe conflict and defence against outside invasions have transformed them into capable and determined warriors, be it with sword, axe, or spear.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_youngbloods	Young Albionites part of the tribes inhabiting the region of Albion known as "the Great Hogs" have a curious rite of passage to prove themselves as warriors. They'll trek to the farthest reaches of the Great Hogs, where they'll track and pluck a bristle out of one of the eponymous gigantic wild pigs, but never damage them in any way, for the people of Albion consider these gigantic creatures sacred. If they succeed, they will march alongside their tribe to war, armed with javelins, serving as skirmishers for Albion's forces.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_woadraider	Woad Raiders are zealous Albionite warriors. They are chosen by the Truthsayers for their extreme devotion to Choteich, the Warrior God of the Sun, and are covered in a mixture of woad made with more exotic and magically active components than the usual woad used by the other inhabitants of Albion. The candidates go through a painful process to get the magical woad on their skin, which drives them slightly insane but also transforms them into fierce, unstoppable warriors. They charge into battle with most of their skin exposed, frothing at the mouth and wielding two swords in a deadly whirlwind of blades and wrath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_bloodhounds	Albion is famous for a special breed of dog known as the Wolfhound, which Albionites keep as pets, guardians, and to assist them during hunts. They also breed a special breed of Wolfhound known as the Bloodhound, which is bred specifically for war. During combat, their handlers will unleash slavering packs of these vicious beasts, using them to support cavalry attacks and harass the more vulnerable enemy troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_giant	According to the Truthsayers' ancient tales, the Old Ones placed the Giants on Albion to guard some of their most sacred sites. It is unknown how Giants came to roam the fog-shrouded island's coasts, but these giants appear to be an entirely separate breed from those that roam the Old World and beyond, being lankier, leaner, and more prone to growing hair than their mainland cousins. Albion's Druids and Truthsayers wield strange power over these Giants, easily compelling them to carry massive stones to erect monoliths, druidic circles, and other megalithic structures with a single word. As a result, during a war, they will unquestioningly accompany the Truthsayers' armies into battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_druid_neophytes	Even if the Cult of the Earthmother (known as the Old Faith elsewhere) is not organised like the cults of the rest of the Old World, its priesthood has levels of hierarchy. The Druidic Priests chose the Initiaties for their affinity with the Mother and the Winds of Magic. They are trained in the basics of their faith and know some basic incantations to ask the Earthmother's aid in defending her land from those who would seek to befoul it, as well as to inspire theit fellow Albionites in battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_stonethrower	Constructed  at the Tower of Llenog, a fort built around a great stone tower said to be an ancient Old One sacred site, these catapults are Albionese adaptations of foreign design, specifically contraptions such as the Bretonnian Trebuchet or the Goblin Rocklobber. Though not as powerful as the former, and not as shabby as the latter, it's an adequate piece of siege artillery, crewed by Druids who handlle all the mystical calculations and movements necessary for the rocks thrown by the machine to hit the right place.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_huntresses	In the harsh realms of Albion, men and women serve as soldiers, hunters, crafters, priests, chieftains, and kings in the harsh realms of Albion, where there is no distinction between genders when it comes to positions in society. Albion's womenfolk frequently follow in the path of the Huntress, expertly following their target. During battle, they'll lend their skills in marksmanship and stealth tactics to the tribe as deadly markswomen, hunting the enemy with the same precision as they do their prey.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_riders	The Hobelars are the light cavalry of Albion's forces, riding a swift and nimble pony breed found only in Albion. With neither stirrups or reins, these valiant warriors strike rapidly and harry Albion's adversaries with sword, spear, and javelin, riding ahead of the rest of the army in a daring manner.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_hearthguard	Oathsworn form the elite personal bodyguard of the Petty Kings and Overkings of Albion Unlike most of the other Albionese troops, they are professional warriors who train day and night to better serve their lieges. Wearing the best equipment available to their tribes, armoured with bronze helmets, mail hauberks, and armed with shields, greataxes, or halberds, they often serve as the heavy infantry of the armies of Albion. Their name comes from their custom of swearing an oath to serve their lieges faithfully unto victory or death upon being initiated into the Oathsworn, no matter the cost.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_hearthguard_2h	Coming from the northern mountainous regions of Albion, the folk of the mountains, known as "Highlanders", are much more fiercely independent than the other tribesmen of Albion. They will rarely march under the orders of one not of their own, unless they have proven themselves. They march to battle in heavier clothing than the rest of the men of Albion, because the mountains and peaks they inhabit are often much harsher and colder in climate than the rest of the island, including their signature kilts, and wield massive two-handed iron swords known as claidheamh mór, or "claymores," crafted by their expert smiths from the abundant ore in their territory. During battle, they will charge at the foe with great ferocity, proclaiming their freedom as they clash with those that would deny it to them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_swordmaiden	In the harsh realms of Albion, men and women serve as soldiers, hunters, crafters, priests, chieftains, and kings in the harsh realms of Albion, where there is no distinction between genders when it comes to positions in society. There's but one exception: the all-female tribe of the Maidenguard, who watches over the Oracles, holy women who have powers of foresight gifted to them by the Old Ones. Not all of them are tasked with guarding the Oracle, and indeed, a good number of them are sent on missions to aid the warriors of Albion in the defence of their land, following the myterious designs of their mistress. These warrior-women are expert and nimble in the art of swordmanship, and can grow quite fierce in the heat of battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_chariot	The natives of Albion are surprisingly skilled at building and riding battle chariots. The horses that pull these chariots are of a local Albionese breed famed for its agility and speed, although they are smaller than those seen elsewhere. This allows the nobles and champions who ride these chariots to quickly manoeuvre and rush at the enemy's flanks and most vulnerable troops. On top of chariots, the Albionese fight by striking with sharp spears from atop and using the momentum generated by their speed to charge into enemy formations and disrupt them.﻿	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_truthsayer_beast	The Truthsayers of Albion—also known as the Soothsayers or the Elder Druids—are a reclusive order of mystics who guide, protect, and lead the peoples of Albion. Originating from a group of Albionese Humans deemed wise enough by the Old Ones to carry on some of their secrets, the Truthsayers follow the true "Path to Enlightement" as laid down by the Old Ones. From their secluded circles and hermitages, they guard the land, and, more importantly, the Ogham Stones laid down by the Old Ones aeons ago. From time to time, they will enlist the aid of the Giants of Albion, who obey their orders unquestioningly, to re-align these stones, or create circles of monoliths around them to channel their power elsewhere, as the Plan of the Old Ones demands. As few in number and seclusive as they are, they have only been partly successful in steering the people of Albion towards the Path to Enlightement, and most of the Albionese have turned to following an imperfect and distorted version of the Truthsayer creed called the Cult of the Earthmother or the Old Faith, which places more emphasis on the godly triad of Ishernos, Choteich and Carnuos and on defending the land of Albion herself from the predations of Chaos, rather than just guarding the Ogham Stones. Despite this, the Truthsayers are venerated as wise leaders and mystics by all, either as keepers of the ancient secrets of the Old Ones or those in closest contact with Ishernos, the Earthmother. Skilled nature wizards, they control the winds of Ghur, Ghyran, and Hysh with incredible mastery for Human wizards. They will also often draw from their own ritualistic kind of magic, drawing strength from the land of Albion itself and the ancient teachings that the Old Ones passed onto the first Truthsayers, to bolster their followers or bring the wrath of Albion upon teir foes.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_centaurs	Though many confuse these half-man, half-horse creatures with other more malign creatures spawned by the forces of Chaos, the Centaurs of Albion are capable of reason and content to live peaceful lives guarding the places of power in Albion, yet they will act furiously against any perceived attempt to defile these sacred lands. The Centaurs were created in ancient times by the Old Ones to help protect the island of Albion, where many of their most important sites were found. To this day, they defend these places, and over time, the Truthsayers have gained their trust as fellow defenders of the legacy of the Old Ones. As such, they will often march with the armies of Albion as powerful shock troops, armed with great axes and equipped with bronze armour, they will bring their strenght to bear against those that would seek to defile Albion.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_warleader	The Overkings, or Ruiri in their native tongue, are the mighty leaders of the many tribes and petty kingdoms of Albion. Much like the leders of the Norscans, these men tend to be warriors of great stature and skill. Yet, unlike the savage Norsemen who lead only by brute force, the Overkings of Albion inspire respect in their subjects with great heroic feats in battle and in defence of the land of Albion. In times when Albion is safe from the predations of the Ruinous Powers, the Overkings will conduct petty wars against each other to prove their worth to their subjects and to increase the amount of land their tribe lays claim to. These border wars will rarely escalate into all out war, for the Overkings know all too well that heavy losses amongst their tribes will only lead to the eventual weakening of Albion, and a failure to defend the island against the forces of Chaos. The Truthsayers do not care for the petty politics of the tribal kings of Albion, and will rarely intervene and steer them away from conflict if they sense that Albion must stand united against an oncoming invasion by the Dark Powers. The Overkings proudly claim descent from many heroes of Albionese legend, such as MacKerog, Agam Rund, Dokko McCoughlagan, or Sìlea McEwman, though most of these claims are hard to prove since the people of Albion do not keep written genealogical records. They will often lead their troops from the front, be it on foot, mounted on one of the agile warhorses of Albion, or one of the famed chariots.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_chief	Petty Kings, Little Chieftains, Tuath-Leaders the rulers of the numerous smaller tribes of Albion have many names.

When the tribes of Albion march to war, they will fight alongside and inspire their fellow tribesmen as heroic figures, trying to hearken back to those legendary figures they claim descent from, performing feats in battle to further distinguish themselves in front of their peers so that one day they might ascend in the hierarchy and become Overkings themselves.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_morrigan	Crow-Maiden, Queen of Ravens, Harbinger of Doom, Murder-Queen, many are the titles and names of the mysterious figure known commonly as Mhorriníon, and even that is likely not her real name, for it only means Daughter of Mhorr - the Albionese God of the Underworld- in the native tongue of Albion.

Always accompanied by a murder of crows, she will appear to lead and fight alongside the hosts of Albion when the battle is most bloody, to sow further carnage among the enemies of the Fog-Shrouded Island. In Albionese myths, she is known as a vindictive, capricious, and passionate figure, bestowing her favour on many mighty heroes of legend if only they bow before her whims. Only a few have scorned the Murder-Queen and lived to tell the tale, for there is no wrath greater than hers when roused. Although a grim and terrible figure, Mhorriníon is a fervent enemy of the Ruinous Powers, and when the forces of Chaos dare to attack her island, she will appear to lead the people of Albion to victory against them. She is beholden to neither the petty politics of the Overkings nor the Great Plan of the Truthsayers, for she jaleously claims Albion as her own, and will rarely recognise any other authority but hers. Only Agam Rund, the first and only High King of Albion has ever won the respect of the Queen of Ravens, After a great battle, she will wander across the battlefield and give the mercy of death to those too wounded to continue. The Albionese consider this a great honour, for she is said to bring their souls into the embrace of her father, Mhorr, Guardian of the Dead, and away from the predations of the forces of Chaos.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_half_giants	The Giant-Blooded, or Aitheach as they call themselves, are a mysterious people who live deep within the forests of Albion, said to be the product of the union between a Giant and a Human, The Aitheach themselves have never claimed such a thing, but there's a certain resemblance in them to both the races of Men and those of the Giants, with their high stature, often dim intellect, and great strength, far beyond that of a normal man. Other legends claim that they are yet another of the numerous guardians tasked with guarding Albion by the Old Ones, chosen from an earlier, primal cousins to Mankind and enchanced by the mystical powers of the ancient shapers of the land. Whatever the case, the Giant-Blooded, as the people of Albion call them, defend the territory they lay claim to ferociously  and it is said that at the center of every one of their forest-villages lies a relic, shrine, or site related to their ancient masters, which they will guard to their last. Only a few Overkings have gained the trust of the Aitheach, but those who have done so have found them effective, if brutish, fighters for their armies. Much like their alleged cousins, the Truthsayers hold great sway over the Giant-Blooded, who will obey their commands almost without question, be it to rearrange the stone circles that channel the power of the ley lines of Albion or to defend the Land from the predations of her enemies.	true

One of the most ancient religions of Man, they primarily follow Ishernos, who is both Earthmother and Skyfather, changing between those aspects with the seasons, though they will pay respect to other regional gods of Albion such as Choitech, Warrior God of the Sun and Carnuos, the Horned One, Master of the Hunt. The Truthsayers tolerate the Cult of the Earthmother, even if it's a distorted version of the teachings of the Old Ones, for it is better that the folk of Albion believe in an imperfect version of the Path than fall under the influence of the Ruinous Powers, as Man often tends to. The Oak Seers have the responsibility in their tribes of officiating ceremonies in worship of the Mother, and taking care of the plants and animals in tribal lands. Their command of the magic of the earth is less impressive than that of the Truthsayers, limited by their interpretation of these powers as invocations of the Mother, but one should not underestimate their powers.

Though ciriticised as impetuous and careless by the more traditional members of the Order, he claims that dire times call for a more active role in defending Albion. And he may be right, for ever since the Great Master of the Citadel of Lead and his Dark Emissaries started corrupting the Ogham Stones for their own dark purposes, a Dark Shadow has fallen over Albion. The land surrounding these corrupted stones has turned evil and twisted, and all kinds of malign creatures prowl it, all the while the armies of the Citadel of Lead plunder and destroy sacred sites of the Old Ones. Dural has even gone so far as to enlist the aid of foreigners, who have arrived in Albion after the magical mists protecting the island dissipated due to the machinations of the Lord of the Citadel of Lead. Dural Durak himself is both a powerful Truthsayer, masterfully wielding the magic of his Order, and a skilled warrior who has already personally defeated several of the fell Dark Emissaries while leading Albion's armies against the forces of the Dark Master, which has gained him the respect and admiration from several of the island's most powerful Overkings. Dural is aided by many sacred artefacts originating in the Forge of the Old Ones, such as the Staff of Light and the Mystic Shield.

The forces of the Citadel of Lead take glee in using these undead warriors against the armies of Albion, for many of these are revered ancestors and heroic legends to the people of the Fog-Shrouded Island.

More heavily armoured than the rest of their peers, they carry great shields and pikes, so as to easily form a defensive circle around their mistress. Of their number, their most widely known champion is Siobhain, who aided the famous heroes Gotrek and Felix in stopping a dark plot by a duo of Chao Sorcerers to take control of the sacred Paths of the Old Ones.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_bologs_giant_ror	Bologs is one of Albion's most powerful Giants, to the point that some Albionese tribes worship him as a god-like figure, and have etched his likeness into the chalk hills of their home, wielding his enormous chopper, hoping to be spared of his wrath. Even for a Giant of Albion, Bologs' intelligence is mediocre at best. All he can do is pronounce his own name in any given situation. In one instance, when a group of Asur merchants managed to reach the shores of Albion, the first being they made contact with was Bologs. When the Elves tried to communicate, all he did was shout "BOLOGS!" and throw one of his choppers at their ship, sinking it. Both Bologs and his brother, Cachtorr share a strange affinity for the Truthsayer known as Hengus the Druid. Whether this man uses magic or clever words to convince them is unknown, but the two Giants follow him everywhere and obey his every command.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_fly_infested_rotwood	As their name indicates, the Fly-Infested Rotwood are a trio of particularly mishappen Fenbeasts, legendary for their origins when an unlucky Truthsayer decided to conjure one of these beasts from one of the bogs polluted by the corruption of Chaos, using a powerful artefact of the Old Ones as a focus, hoping the summoned creature would absorb and syphon the corruption out of the bog. The result was more successful than he expected, as the corruption coalesced into three living, hulking masses of damp, rotten wood, which produced a noxious odour. The corrupt creatures soon turned against him, killing the Truthsayer and rampaging around the forests and villages surrounding the bog, until a group of Truthsayers confronted the beasts and managed to bind them to their wills. Since then, they have been sent at the vanguard of Albion's armies, hoping that the enemy will eventually destroy the wretched beasts. So far, no one has managed to truly slay them, for even when their forms are destroyed, they manage to come back again, their crude forms putting themselves together from the detritus of the battlefield.	true

All of them are disgraced tribesmen who have committed a great crime or offence in the eyes of the Truthsayers and are "imprisoned" by them with a magical woad paint made of the criminal's old blood. Using magic rituals best left undescribed, the Truthsayers bind these men to their will, unleashing them in battle where their impotent rage will be channelled against their enemy. Only if they survive for five gruelling years and repent for their crimes will they be freed of their enchantments and be allowed to return to their normal lives; the Red Woad will stay with them, a reminder of never acting in such a criminal way against the Truthsayers ever again.	true

The Firstborn Sons are made up of these young Albionese princelings from various tribes banded together, seeking to prove themselves. Armed with the best mail and weapons in their tribes and riding the fastest horses, they will valiantly charge to battle to seek the respect that will enable them to become the future rulers of the tribes of Albion.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_warriors_lugh	The men of Albion hold great reverence for their Warrior Sun-God, Choteich. Many legends are told about him in Albionese myth, as a high king, a mighty smith, a great warrior, and a saviour of Albion, known as the "Long-Armed" for his prowess in many skills. There's no Overking that will not claim descent from him through some or other ancestor of theirs. None are more devoted to him than the Warriors of Choteich, a warband of zealous Albionese warriors who have sworn an oath to serve him unto death. As such, the Truthsayers have channelled some of the Sun-God's power into them in rituals that enhanced these men with great vigour and infused their blades with unquenching fire, as hot as the sun itself, that only burns those who wish to harm the land of Albion and the Ogham Stones, sacred to Choteich. The Lizardmen who recently arrived on the island's northern shores to support the Truthsayers in their conflict against the Dark Emissaries, have been spotted observing these warriors with a curious fascination.	true

The Isle is now a cursed place where many of the ancient kings and champions of Albion once rested peacefully. However, with the recent disappearance of the Mists and the coming of the Dark Emissaries, the place has become corrupted, and now the dead roam the land again, aimless and bloodthirsty. Not only that, but the abominable Fimir, ancient enemies of Albion have established an outpost there, and need to be kept at bay, lest they raid the coastal villages for slaves to sacrifice to their unholy masters. Thus, the Wardens are tasked with stopping any undead from coming out of the Isle of Wights, and keeping the Fimir raiding parties at bay. Skilled archers, they have been granted enhanced magical bows by the Oracle, which help them slay both common creatures and malign beasts with ease. While the Wardens keep watch, no evil shall creep out of the dark Isle of Wights.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_centaur_hunter_ror	Though most of the Centaurs guarding the lands of Albion prefer to live in the forests that naturally grow around the shrines of the Old Ones they're meant to defend, there's a pack of Centaurs who are an exception to this rule. Known as the "Riders of the Plains of Battle", they roam the eponymous area, a featureless expanse of land with barely any vegetation and constantly miserably rainy weather, even for such a dreary place as Albion. Many a battle has been fought here, be it between Albionese tribes, against the Forces of Chaos or whatever other foreign threat assalied the northern coasts of Albion. So much blood has been spilled here that the muddy plans have become red with it, and it is said to be the reason the Riders of the Plains of Battle roam the place, driven mad by the smell of blood, throwing their axes with wild aim and deadly accuracy at any who enter the place. Only the Truthsayers are able to clear their madness, for a time, during which the grateful creatures will put their talents to use in defence of the Truthsayters and the Land of Albion, only to eventually revert to their natural state when the Truthsayers return them to the Plains of Battle. It is unknown why the Order does so, but it's likely part of the unknowable Plan laid by the ancient Old Ones.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_albion_cachtorr_stonethrower	While Cachtorr is not as mighty as his brother Bologs, he's conversely much more intelligent than his brother will ever be, more intelligent indeed than even the average giant. He is known for fighting a terrible Giant couple—Dong and Mea-Dong—who were terrorising the villages surrounding the Giants Causeway. He single-handedly engaged the Giant and his Giant-Wife there, where they threw rocks at each other, and emerged victorious thanks to his smarts in realising that he could throw more stones if he picked smaller ones, and the fact that having a single eye made him a better stone thrower ( as long as the objective isn't too far ), filling the entire place with stones that serve now both as sacred menhirs to the people of Albion and tombs for the Giant couple. Cachtorr and his brother, Bologs, share a strange affinity for the Truthsayer known as Hengus the Druid. Whether this man uses magic or clever words to convince them is unknown, but the two Giants follow him everywhere and obey his every command. He has also given a special gift to Cachtorr, a magical menhir that will split into a rain of stones when thrown against the enemy, only to reform in front of Cachtor unharmed. This only lasts a few times before the enchantment wears off and the stone no longer reassembles.	true

Paradoxically, they also inhabit one of the most advanced and best defended settlements in Albion, Carn Mallog itself, a mountain fort composed of several stone towers painted with a woad that is said to offer them protection and stability. The men of Carn Mallog, thus, are adept at defending the high ground, and more restrained in their zeal for battle than their fellow Highlanders, though not less ferocious because of it. Their current ruler is a man known as Bran MacKerog, is said to be an old friend of the current Oracle of the Truthsayers, and will put his entire tribe to her service if the need arises.	true

They will revert to mud and decaying marsh detritus if their summoner is slain.

Griffons are noble and proud creatures, and outside of hunting, they will only strike at other creatures if they openly threaten them or their territory.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_alb_viridian_champ	The Chosen of Ishernos are mighty heroes of Albionese myth who once faithfully died for the Earthmother in some incredible feat in defence of the land and were deemed worthy of having the Ritual of Earth-Binding conducted on their corpses by the Druids of Albion. It's a process where their bodies are laid on a clearing sacred to Ishernos by the Druids, who place a tiny Ogham Stome on their torsos and call for the Mother to absorb both their bodies and souls in her warm embrace. The bodies rapidly decay and are absorbed by the nearby plant life. Instantly, the plant life infused with the enchanted remains and souls of those warriors takes on a humanoid shape, similar to that of the hero in life, and is infused with the warrior's undying will. The Chosen of Ishernos constantly regenerate any wounds in battle by drawing from the lifeforce of nearby plantlife, though this ability has certain limits, and they will eventually collapse if they take too much damage, or if the Ogham Stone inside them is fractured in some way. Armed with the moss-covered axes and rusty armour that they died wearing, these otherworldly warriors are an inspiring sight to behold for the folk of Albion, and a terrifying one for their foes.	true

It is unknown how Giants came to roam the fog-shrouded island's coasts, but these giants appear to be an entirely separate breed from those that roam the Old World and beyond, being lankier, leaner, and more prone to growing hair than their mainland cousins. Albion's Druids and Truthsayers wield strange power over these Giants, easily compelling them to carry massive stones to erect monoliths, druidic circles, and other megalithic structures with a single word. As a result, during a war, they will unquestionably accompany the Truthsayers' armies into battle. Some Giants have been known to throw chunks of stone at their foes with relative precision, chunks that they will also use to smash their enemies into bloody pulps, in a great feat of intelligence (for one of their race, anyway).	true
