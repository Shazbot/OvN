cultures_frontend_description_ovn_albion	Shrouded in an impenetrable magical mist, farr off the western coast of Norsca lies the island of Albion. Chosen by the Old Ones in ancient times to be one of their strongholds, the island was a perfect paradise, a sunny land of bountiful crops where the Old Ones gathered the wisest and most skilled of each of the races they had seeded the world with. It is said that they first taught the elves the art of spellcasting and the dwarfs the art of forging magic into runes in this location.At first, man was deemed too primitive to be taught anything, but the Old Ones were surprised by how fast their youngest creation adapted to change, and so they took the brightest and wisest amongst them and taught them some of their secrets. These were called 'Truthsayers', and they would spread the true path to enlightenment as dictated by the Old Ones. After the collapse of the Polar Gates, the Old Ones fled, and the Truthsayers built stone cricles with the aid of Giants to channel the powers of Chaos against themselves, shrouding their paradise island in an eternal mist. It was a high price to pay, but the mist would now forever protect Albion and its people from the predation of the Ruinous Powers. The Men of Albion have been led by the Truthsayers ever since, rarely venturing outside their shrouded island, but valiantly defending it from those that managed to pierce the shroud, fighting with fierce determination against the servants of the Chaos Gods and the curruptiing nature of Chaos, always trying to seep into their homeland. The people of Albion are brushed-off as primitive in their ways of war by the "civilized" folk of the Old World, but their prowess and bravery in battle should not be underestimated. They favour light troops and skirmishing tactics, but also counting with heavier support and their famed chariots, all part of their noble caste. Their more mystical support comes from the Truthsayers and various fearsome guardians assigned by the Old Ones to keep watch on the island and defend the people of Albion, such as centaurs and giants. Woe to the enemy that underestimates the hosts of Albion, for their fierce determination in battle should not be confused with savage barbarism.	false
