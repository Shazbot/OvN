dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_cathay_caravan	Caravan Encounter! Cathay Caravan	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_cathay_caravan	A lonely Caravan has been spotted trundling through nearby land, bearing the banners of Cathay. No doubt the products of the so-called Celestial Empire would be worth snatching for ourselves, yet such spoils are not likely to lie unguarded.\\n\\nA choice between killing or caution. It seems the answer is clear...	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_dwarfs	A wandering Caravan of Dwarfs has entered our sight. Should we attack them for a fresh new set of slaves?	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_far_from_home	Signs of a troop column have been spotted ahead. Judging by the tracks, it looks as though this force has been moving without sleep or pause. Cresting the next hill, the gleam of bone and gold can be seen throughout the army. A host of Tomb Kings, richly adorned, is marching through this area. Their destination is unclear, but their opulence is not. We could descend upon them, and claim their riches for ourselves!	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_fresh_battlefield	Caravan Encounter! Fresh Battlefield	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_fresh_battlefield	It seems like there was a big battle nearby, we can take some of the remnants or use the equipment to empower the existing troops. 	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_hungry_daemons	Caravan Encounter! Hungry Daemons	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_hungry_daemons	Traversing realms is hungry work if these Daemons we've encountered are to be believed. You could choose to sate their gluttonous appetites in the hopes of avoiding a fight. Yet, on the other hand, death would solve their hunger too…	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_localised_elfs	Caravan Encounter! Elfy Profits	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_localised_elfs	Unfortunate wretches of many races travel the sea to gather wealth. Yet while out on assignment, even our Caravan knows not to pass up the opportunity to attain more of the "right tools" for the job, having encountered a High Elf host from whom much profit could be forcibly reaped – both in long-limbed Labourers and loot reaped from beardless corpses.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_offence_or_defence	Caravan Encounter! Dark Magic Artefact	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_offence_or_defence	A great artefact of dark magic has come to our grasp. However, we need to decide which equipment we should empower to give the Caravan the greatest chance of successfully repelling any threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_ogre_mercenaries	Caravan Encounter! Ogre Mercenaries	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_ogre_mercenaries	The strength of an Ogre is unmatched anywhere! At least, that's what this group of rotund mercenaries assured us when offering to guard our trade Caravan on its route. Their claim is ridiculous but the extra muscle wouldn't go amiss. Ogres' services, however, certainly would not come free of charge.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_power_overwhelming	Caravan Encounter! A Whisper	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_power_overwhelming	Without warning, a sudden chill rushes through the bones.

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_quick_way_down	The Caravan Master scouts a quicker route which would make up for the lost time. However, looking at the weather, that shortcut would result in some damaged 'goods'.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_rats_in_a_tunnel	Caravan Encounter! Rats	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_rats_in_a_tunnel	This ship is filled with rats! Unless we have dealt with them sooner or we will have to make a stop to refill our supplies. Maybe we need to track them all and kill them.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_redeadify	Caravan Encounter! Skulking Horde	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_redeadify	Fog has descended around our Caravan. The smell is putrid and shuffling shapes can be glimpsed in the haze. This land around us teems with their shambling forms; we have stumbled, unwittingly, into the domain of the Undead. These creatures can be confronted head-on and the wretches put down for good or, alternatively, we can order some of our number to distract them while we make our escape, though they will ultimately have no hope against the necrotic masses.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_the_ambush	Caravan Encounter! The Ambush	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_the_ambush	Stealth is possibly not the strong suit of our would-be ambushers, who visibly await our Caravan from some rather questionable 'hiding' places. We could avoid them easily, of course, but it almost seems a disservice not to show them what a true ambush looks like...	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_the_guide	Caravan Encounter! The Guide	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_the_guide	A guide has tracked down our Caravan, offering to lead the way to our destination in exchange for a reasonable donation to his pockets. His price is frankly extortionate, but as they say in business, time is of the essence.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	Caravan Encounter! The Beastmaster	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_trading_dark_elfs	A cacophony of roars and feral shrieks rings out ahead of your Caravan – a Dark Elf Beastmaster approaches! By the look of his shackled beasts, he is recently returned from an expedition into Norsca and poses little threat, his retinue of hunters visibly weary and battered from their run-ins with the Northmen and critters of the tundra. With a tired Druchii sneer, he offers the Caravan one of his creatures in exchange for some slaves. Though we care little for the Dark Elf’s plight, such a beast could be useful against future threats.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_training_camp	Caravan Encounter! Duelling Shrine	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_training_camp	The day may have just begun, but one of the scouts has already spotted a wide, flat, stone platform in an isolated area. A series of eight steps leads to an eight-sided arena, with grooves carved in the floor to drain the blood spilled. Unmistakably, this is a Khornate combat shrine: the perfect location to tutor troops and beat the weakness out of them.	false
dilemmas_localised_title_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_way_of_lava	Caravan Encounter! The Path of Storms	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_way_of_lava	A strong current is in front of our eyes. We can traverse this rough current and reach our destination sooner, but it may take the lives of some of our weaker personnel.	false

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_skaven_ambush	Along the road, some of your caravaneers are ambushed, the sky being blotted out with smoke and chittering filling the air.

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_def_black_ark_reinforcement_battle	Your caravan is halted by a far-flung Black Ark, seemingly here for piracy. Eyeing your slaves, and desperate for anything, they make a deal. They will take some of your slaves, and you will take some of their finest soldiers.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_cst_treasure_map	It is no secret that the southern seas are home to many hidden coves and islands where the pirates of Sartosa like to hide their booty. As it happens you spot a pirate crew digging around on a shore not too far away from you. Fighting them might not be part of your route but it might get you whatever they are looking for… 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_hef_tax_reinforcement_battle	The High Elves are infamous for thinking of themselves as the guardians of the world, this part included. A force sent from Ulthuan to one of their far-flung colonies happens upon your caravan and makes it very clear that you are to pay a tax to the Phoenix court for conducting trade here. Of course, some handlers would have to be assigned to you for the rest of your journeys too to keep you “safe”. They don’t seem to give us much of a choice...	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_wooden_lamp	Your caravan stops some distance from a gigantic lamp-shaped tree. Is it merely a mirage? Surely a foreboding one, and right in the middle of the only viable path. What should we do? 	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_brt_errant	Our Caravan has come upon a minor Bretonnian Errantry led by a Noble bearing the familial name of one of the original Bretonnian Crusaders who invaded our shores!

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_hef_tribute	 Our Caravan has been halted by a force of High Elves who demand we pay the customary Tribute to the Phoenix King, the Elves think these trade-routes are their property and are citing all sorts of ancient treaties to prove their claim.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_def_corsair	Our Caravans are used to dealing with Corsairs from our own shores, but this time some intrepid Corsair Captain has organised a large force to halt our progress and demands we hand over tribute to be allowed safe passage.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_emp_mercenaries	We have stumbled upon a band of Soldiers of Fortune from the Northern Empire. While their customs and beliefs are weird, especially their dogmatic belief in their man god ‘Sigmar’, they can be reliable soldiers. Let's hope they learn to wash themselves properly while in our employ if we hire them.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_chd_cannon_reinforcement_battle	We spotted a smoke column in the distance, upon further inspection we noticed that it was moving, specifically it is moving towards us; it’s a Chaos Dwarf convoy, led by a priest of Hashut, upon their approach, they make their intentions clear: they are looking to trade, and they won't take no for an answer.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_dwf_thane_reinforcement_battle	As we track across the lands near the mountains you spotted a Dwarfen caravan. Upon the approach one Thane approached and wishes to follow along with our caravan because of grudges against members of his current group. But the sharp eyes amongst you also notice that the caravan also brings with them plenty of treasure, and for those with a thirst for more gold this is easy pickings.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_vmp_shortcut	 As our caravan stops for the night at a shady oasis they encounter a tribe of the nomadic Strigany people. These folk ply the roads same as us but their customs are odd to say the least. The head of the tribe, a wise-woman bedecked in patchwork fabrics and fetishes of bone, meets with our caravan leader and offers to guide us to a shortcut through these dangerous lands in exchange for some of our cargo.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_fimir_battle	Strange mists surround our caravan as we are forced to push the wagons through a muddy mire. The beasts of burden are ill at ease as bloated flies hover over us like buzzards circling a desert meal and the thick, humid air makes each laboured breath harder to endure. Just when we thought things couldn’t get any worse, a shrill cry is heard over the din of swamplife and a ululating horde of one-eyed monsters emerge from the waters with crude weapons and vile magic in hand.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_teb_reinforcement	It is said that our caravan leader is a paramour of the famed Princess of Pavona herself, Lucrezzia Belladonna.

dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_gnoblar_reinforcement	While travelling on the road our caravan spots a lumbering beast hauling a ramshackle wagon crewed by a scrawny bunch of Gnoblars. The wagon pulls alongside of us and the head of this odd band, a spectacled Gnoblar wearing a turban of Arabyan fashion, speaks to our caravan leader of his journeys throughout these lands. He eyes our cargo the entire time and he asks for some of it to fund his latest invention, the Gnoblar Gnose Gnourisher. He offers you the services of his guards in return for your shiny scrap.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_tmb_reinforcement_battle	While travelling along the rolling dunes of Nehekhara our caravan chances upon a tomb that has been uncovered by the desert winds. The tomb appears to be untouched by time and ripe for the picking. Once inside, the men encounter a regally dressed skeleton who claims to be a prince and that our caravan leader is his long lost king. The skeleton promises to guard his “king” for eternity but all the men see are the riches that were buried here alongside the prince.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_dk_battle	As our caravan traverses past a once empty ruin they notice that there is a gleaming light far down the road. The caravan approaches this light but it soon resolves into the image of an army on the march. Rank upon rank of skeletons march in perfect lockstep and hulking beasts of bone are spotted behind them. It appears they are marching this way and they most definitely see the caravan.	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_brt_battle	While travelling through foreign lands, your caravan encounters a local force equipped with fine blades of ensorcelled Arabyan steel. Very familiar blades, as a matter of fact. Upon inquiring about the situation, you discover that these blades were recovered from an Arabyan shipwreck their master recently looted. One of your merchant vessels, it seems, lost at sea not too long ago. By rights, these blades are yours.	false

The caravan master scoffs, for surely this lesser caravan cannot match our wealth and glory. But then we see them, riders on Flying Carpets! Outrageous! How dare this lesser caravan have such prestigious allies?!	false
dilemmas_localised_description_rhox_araby_jaffar_dilemma_arb_rope	As we come to a desert outpost, we see a terrible sight. The guards are all missing, and blood is everywhere! As we search the outpost to discover what could have caused such a tragedy, the men shout in alarm! A swarm of furious Rope Djinns, angered at having been bound in such a manner, ready themselves to attack!	false
