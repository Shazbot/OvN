unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_art_grand_bombard	One of the many inventions of the Natural Philosophers of Araby, the Grand Bombard is a great bronze cannon mounted on an elaborate chassis. Famous for their use in cracking open heavy fortifications, they are also quite effective against infantry formations.\\n\\nThese war machines are a point of pride for the wealthy rulers of Araby, and both the cannons and the structures they are mounted on are lavishly decorated.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_art_grand_bombard_ror	The ‘Howling Basilisk’, as it has come to be known, is a dreaded war machine made by an Arabyan Sorcerer whose name has been long lost to time. After witnessing the daemon-possessed artillery of the twisted Dawi-Zharr of the Dark Lands, the Sorcerer sought to replicate their work using Arabyan methods by binding a raging Fire Efreet to a grand bombard. The binding was not perfect, and the elemental spirit was left in a state of constant rage, trapped in the machine. Suffice it to say, this was the end of the Sorcerer who created the Howling Basilisk.\\n\\nIn spite of its tempestuous nature, the machine still sees use today in the hosts of the Sultans, but the crew needs to be regularly replaced, as the machine’s spirit tends to drive the poor sods insane.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_arabyan_knights	The people of Araby, no matter if they come from the city or the desert, are expert horse riders and take great pride in their limber, fast horses of Ulthuani stock. On the battlefield, the Arabyan Knights use the speed of their mounts to enact quick and deadly charges into the rear of enemy lines.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_arabyan_knights_ror	The Desert Dogs are a notorious band of Arabyan riders who hail from the vast and arid deserts. They are seasoned raiders and skirmishers who specialise in swift and silent attacks on unsuspecting villages and caravans. They ride on white horses that are as fast as the wind and as hardy as the sand. They wear light armour and cloaks that wrap around their faces and bodies, protecting them from the harsh sun and the curious gaze of their foes.\\n\\nTheir leader is a man of mystery, Werner Glook, a rogue from the Empire who abandoned his rich and noble family and their cruel school in Marienburg. Eventually, he travelled to Araby, where fate led him to become known as “Al-Muktar”, the Chosen One, a prophetic figure among the people of the desert, and the leader of the bandit gang now known as the Desert Dogs.\\n\\nThe Desert Dogs of Al-Muktar are now rightly feared and respected throughout Araby and beyond.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_archer_camel	The archetypical Arabyan mount, the sturdy camel, has been used for generations by the desert nomads of inner Araby for transport and war. Nevertheless, they can be unruly beasts, kicking and stomping at those who disturb them.\\n\\nThe people of Araby have mastered the art of riding these desert animals, to the point of being able to shoot bows while mounted in battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_bedouin_scouts	Nowhere is the art of horsemanship more cultivated in Araby than among the peoples of the inner desert, where it is both a sign of adulthood and a necessity to be an expert horse rider. Mounted upon their limber and fast horses – said to be of the same stock as the steeds of the Elves – these riders pepper their foes with deadly javelins before sweeping in for a quick rear charge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_scorpion	The largest and fiercest scorpions in all the world require a rider who wears magical robes of protection that can cut through the sand.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_sipahis	The archetypical Arabyan mount, the sturdy camel, has been used for generations by the desert nomads of inner Araby for transport and war. Nevertheless, they can be unruly beasts, kicking and stomping at those who disturb them.\\n\\nThese beasts are not exclusively the province of the desert nomads; the city folk of Araby have mastered the art of camel riding, and the sheikhs of Araby have incorporated them into their armies as elite shock units. Heavily armoured riders and beasts thunder across the sands in gilded mail, banners snapping in the wind, their roars echoing over the dunes. The charge of the camel cataphracts of Araby is feared all across the Old World.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_sipahis_ror	Hailing from the – even for Arabyan standards – fabulously wealthy city of Copher, the Sipahis are composed of the sons of the highborn of the city. Arrogant, flashy, and proud like the peacock, these young nobles ride to battle armoured in glittering golden armour, both the riders and their horses of purebred Arabyan stock.\\n\\nInspired by the legends of the mythical Golden King of Copher, these brave (and some would say foolish) young men charge head-first into enemy lines, hoping to trample the foe with the momentum of their mounts, their deadly long lances, and their contemptuous attitude.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_tuareg_riders	UNUSED	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_champion	Bodyguards, champions, and caretakers of the palace at the same time, the Emirs are often the trusted right hand of the various rulers of Araby when it comes to military matters. Often deadly warriors in their own right, the Emirs are usually not recruited from the ruler’s own troops. Instead, most tend to be foreigners – be they from other Arabyan cities, from the kingdoms of the brave Southlanders to the south, or even Northerners from the Old World.\\n\\nThis has long been custom in Araby, since the nobility of this land is rife with political intrigues of all kinds – often of the deadly variety – and rulers prefer to have their trusted bodyguards hold little or no stake in these games.\\n\\nWhatever the case, Emirs are deadly warriors who often train the armies of Araby and defend the honour of the Sultans on the battlefield.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_elephant	The dreaded Arabyan Elephant is perhaps one of the better-known creatures to march in the armies of the Sultans, forever branded into the collective memory of Old Worlders during Araby’s invasion of the north in the time of the Crusades.\\n\\nThese big, lumbering creatures are trained from birth by specialised tamers, and their maintenance is generally costly – which is usually not a problem for the affluent sheikhs.\\n\\nThere is some ongoing animosity between the peoples of Araby and Ind about who exactly mastered the art of elephant husbandry first, and who stole it from the other, for armies of both lands make extensive use of these deadly animals.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_fatandira	After being ousted from the Borderlands, Princess Fatandira returned to her native people, the Scythan tribes of Araby. She and her people serve their Tomb King God Tutankhanut of Numas.\\n\\nFatandira sees herself as an enlightened monarch. She seeks to create a land free of the bigotry and hate that imprison the minds of men. She is also a canny woman with a keen eye and an iron will. She can be coy and subtle if required, but she prefers directness. She does not approve of lying, cheating, stealing, or any of the other faults often assumed of her people. She has no compunctions against fighting for control but also accepts treaties and other agreements. If someone breaks an oath with her once, however, she will never trust that person again.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_flying_carpet	Perhaps one of the most famous Arabyan artefacts, the ‘flying carpets’ are created by binding a lesser Djinn into a mundane carpet. The resulting union animates the carpet, giving it the ability to fly with astounding agility and quickness.\\n\\nThe Djinn animating the carpet is usually not very intelligent and behaves like a playful animal; as such, many of these artefacts end up being ‘domesticated’ by daring Arabyan youths, who then proceed to use them as mounts, performing all sorts of daring and dangerous aerial manoeuvres.\\n\\nThese Carpet Riders are often recruited into the armies of the Sultans, where their maverick attitude is put to good use as air-skirmisher troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_flying_carpet_ror	Owing their name to their late founder, a nobleman called Sagash, the Naffatun of Sagash are an elite corps of carpet riders from the city of Barrakesh, renowned for the expertise of its carpet riders and the rich artistry and quality of the artefacts themselves.\\n\\nWhile some might think of this as a suicidal idea – riding animated cloth furniture as they do – the riders use a kind of explosive chemical known as ‘nafta’, for which the Naffatun are named. This chemical is stored in small clay pots that, when ignited with the smallest spark, explode into deadly fire. The Naffatun are considered either very foolish or very brave, and the turnover rate in their corps is, unsurprisingly, very high.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_golden_magus	The mysterious southern sorcerer known only as the Golden Magus has always been a figure of fascination amongst the scurvy citizens of the Tilean pirate isle of Sartosa. Rich beyond measure and eccentric in the extreme, the self-styled Sultan of the Seas has variously claimed to be a merchant prince, an exiled patriarch of the Colleges of Magic, and even, at one point, the Golden King of Copher reborn. Regardless of his true identity, his unpredictable and devious nature is infamous in the gambling dens and rot-houses of Sartosa. Though in truth he is also a Tzeentchian sorcerer.\\n\\nThe Golden Magus takes great pains to give the appearance of a wise man rather than a warrior. His one remaining eye is ringed with kohl, his robes are of the finest embroidered silk, and his skin is dusted with powdered gold. To the casual onlooker, the Golden Magus is a man of exotic tastes and refined manner. Only those who have seen him in action can attest to the fact that underneath his sophisticated exterior he is lethal indeed. The Magus can move with a speed that belies his advanced age, and his ever-burning blade – from which his warship takes its name – is enchanted with a hundred fiery curses.\\n\\nThe Golden Magus’ true power lies in his magic, for he is able to summon spirits of the air, of the ocean, and of flame. His secret lies under the minarets of his pleasure barge, the Flaming Scimitar. These exotic buildings are host to a maze of concentric corridors, amongst which are dozens of hidden storerooms. Within their storage spaces are barrels of stolen treasure, exotic spices, narcotic incense, statuary from the Far East, the jewelled skeletons of hideous sea-monsters, and a pair of clockwork Thundertusks that obey the Magus’ commands. The sorcerer’s most precious treasures are even more bizarre – contained within rank upon rank of magical jars that line the central chamber of each gold-topped minaret.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_alrahem_nomads	The desert nomads of Araby claim to continue the lifestyle of their ancestors. Long before coming into contact with the great Priest Kings of fallen Nehekhara, the peoples of Araby were nomads, roaming from oasis to oasis in the Great Desert and avoiding the fertile coast, occupied mostly by the arrogant Asur and their gleaming colonies.\\n\\nEventually, the Elves abandoned their colonies, and many of these nomads occupied them, becoming the modern city-folk of Araby. Some others – tribes such as the Al’rahem, the Zamesi, and the Muktarhin – remained as nomads.\\n\\nProud of their heritage to this day, the Sultans forge pacts and temporary alliances to recruit trackers and hunters of these tribes into their armies as archers and skirmishers; their expertise in striking unseen with their bows in the calm of the desert is rightly feared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_bowmen	Drafted from the lower class of the city folk – the foragers and hunters living in the outskirts of the Arabyan cities – these bowmen are not as skilled as the legendary desert nomads, but they’re more easily recruited and trained. Even so, the affluent rulers of Araby take great pride in giving even the less prestigious roles in their army lavishly decorated uniforms, as can be gleaned from the ostentatious headgear and masks of the average Arabyan archer in their hosts.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_guard	Trained from birth and forever loyal to their lieges, the Palace Guard are some of the most elite infantry in the hosts of Araby. Charged with protecting the rulers of Araby and their closest families at all times, they need to be highly dependable men, and so they are often recruited from war orphans and other children who have lost their parents and have no familial connections that could compromise their loyalty to their lieges. Despite this, they enjoy a privileged status throughout their lives.\\n\\nIn battle, they are fierce soldiers, clad in heavy ‘mirror’ scale armour, equipped with deadly halberds and a grim determination to protect their lords. They will fight to the end to defend their masters.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_ogres	The brutish ogres are a powerful ally to have on the battlefield, that is until they flee at the first sign of trouble.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_spearmen	Drafting levies is a rarity in Araby; indeed, the wealthy Arabyan elites prefer to arm, dress, and train professional soldiers using their vast wealth – and indeed they do – for watching even the lowest ranks of an Arabyan army is like watching a parade of deadly peacock soldiers, ostentatious and proud.\\n\\nThe spear, ever the humblest of weapons, is also heavily appreciated by Arabyan generals as a basic and dependable tool of war that helps keep enemy cavalry at bay.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_spearmen_summon	All is not what it seems...	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_warriors	Drafting levies is a rarity in Araby; indeed, the wealthy Arabyan elites prefer to arm, dress, and train professional soldiers using their vast wealth – and indeed they do – for watching even the lowest ranks of an Arabyan army is like watching a parade of deadly peacock soldiers, ostentatious and proud.\\n\\nThe swordsmen of Araby prefer to use blades specialised in cutting deeply rather than hacking and stabbing; from scimitars to sabres to tulwars, most Arabyan soldiers are trained in the use of these deadly weapons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_corsairs	From the day the first Arabyans settled near the ample coast of their homeland, there have been pirates, corsairs, and other sea bandits plaguing the wealthy sea routes of Araby. Daring, rowdy, and roguish, these outlaws of the oceans come from all walks of life – city folk seeking adventure, renegade desert nomads, and proud men from the Southlands – all come together under the black flag for the promise of booty and plunder.\\n\\nThese underhanded fighters prefer unorthodox tactics, from throwing sand into the faces of their foes to interrupting a sword duel by shooting their unfortunate opponent with a flintlock – all is fair in love and piracy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_dervishers	Zealous servants of the Djinn, these fanatics are drawn from the most fervent worshippers of the nature spirits of Araby. Such is their zeal that in battle they will descend into a euphoric trance, spinning madly, trying to kill as many unbelievers as possible before falling themselves, all while singing praises to their elemental masters. They are famous for covering their heads completely in elaborate headdresses decorated with images and votive relics dedicated to the Djinn. This headgear obscures their faces completely, leaving them blind and possibly deaf. The Dervishers worry not about this, for it is the will of their many gods that drives them forward to strike at their hated foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_warriors_ror	A legendary figure amongst the people of Araby, Mullah Aklan’d is credited with driving out the last Asur inhabiting the Arabyan coasts and conquering the final remnants of their colonies. His elite guard, the Death Commandos, were said to be devout and fanatical to the last, fighting with a fierceness that frightened the usually stoic Elves.\\n\\nMullah Aklan’d has been dead for centuries now, but his name has become a title, inherited by the most worthy of the Death Commandos.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_jezzails	Adopted from Cathayan designs brought as gifts or trade goods, the Jezzail is a long-barrelled gunpowder rifle. One might think such an advanced weapon would be the province of the city folk of Araby, but it is the desert nomads who make the most use of it, employing its longer reach to strike unseen from great distances.\\n\\nIt is widely believed that the devious Skaven took the name of these guns for their own Warplock Jezzails, even if the ratmen’s invention itself derives from adopted Dwarfen designs.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_jezzails_ror	The Malaluk are the descendants of the former inhabitants of Bel-Aliad, an Arabyan city destroyed by Arkhan the Black during the Wars of Death – Arkhan’s genocidal war against the people of Araby. The Malaluk were forced into nomadism and now guard the cursed ruins of Bel-Aliad with fierce determination. They are isolationist and territorial to the extreme, forgiving no trespass into what they consider their rightful land.\\n\\nThey cover themselves from head to toe in thick layers of cloth, use finely crafted Jezzail firearms, and wield strange maces with a pineapple-shaped head that have been dubbed ‘Malaluk Sticks’ by those few who have survived.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_pit_fighters	Pit Fighters are slaves taken from other nations and forced to fight for their lives in the arenas of Araby, captured from peoples the slavers of Araby consider ‘barbarous’ and ‘war-like’, such as the Norscans or Kurgan. Pit Fighters are equipped with spiked gauntlets suited more for spectacle than battle and wear little armour, relying on brute force and toughness to survive.\\n\\nPit Fighters are fearless and ruthless, willing to face any foe – even monstrous beasts and daemons – for the chance of freedom or glory. They are highly sought after as mercenaries and bodyguards by the wealthy and powerful rulers of Araby.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_sharkas_slaves	Slavery of fellow men is an unfortunate truth in most of the cities of Araby. The slave masters of Araby purchase all kinds of prisoners of war, criminals, debtors, and rebels, treating them like cattle and making them work in the worst conditions (often not even given proper footwear). Worse yet, some of the more callous Sultans might decide to herd these poor souls into battle, arming them with shoddy work implements and whatever other weapons they can scrounge up.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_southland_warriors	Perhaps one of the hardiest and most resilient nations of Men, the people of the Southlands have inhabited their dangerous continent for as long as history can remember. Through fierce determination, they have managed to eke out an existence in the jungles and savannahs of the Southlands, fighting off fearsome creatures both mundane and magical. Their jungle cities and villages stand proud against Lizardmen, Skaven, and whatever other dangers the land throws at them.\\n\\nA custom among their hardiest warriors is to kill a fearsome lion with their bare hands, skin the creature, and wear its pelt over their shoulders or head. These proven champions then journey into the lands of Araby to hire themselves out as highly sought-after bodyguards and mercenaries.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_jezzail_camel	The archetypical Arabyan mount, the sturdy camel, has been used for generations by the desert nomads of inner Araby for transport and war. Nevertheless, they can be unruly beasts, kicking and stomping at those who disturb them.\\n\\nThe desert nomads, ever the skilled archers and riders, have mastered the art of shooting their bows from atop these tempestuous beasts with effective results.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_lancer_camel	The archetypical Arabyan mount, the sturdy camel, has been used for generations by the desert nomads of inner Araby for transport and war. Nevertheless, they can be unruly beasts, kicking and stomping at those who disturb them.\\n\\nIn battle, the most basic use of these animals is as mounts for warriors equipped with lances. They have little staying power, but their strength lies in the fearsome nature of the camel, striking decisive blows against the rear of enemy formations.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_magician_desert	Araby has a long and storied magical tradition, and whether they were taught by the Elves, the Djinn, or some other beings is not known. There’s little to no taboo against magic in Araby, with sorcerers, magicians, mystics, and fakirs freely practising their craft. The fact that Araby lies far from the poles of the world, and thus has a lower risk of exposure to the ravages of Chaos, also helps.\\n\\nIt is seen as a way to draw closer to the divine essence of the Djinn, and as such, the study of magic is considered both a sacred and prestigious endeavour – seen as a science to be harnessed, not a perilous energy as the unenlightened men of the Old World believe.\\n\\nMany schools of magic have formed in Araby: the Elementalist school, whose mages draw power from the four Royal Djinn to empower their magics of water, fire, sand, and air; and the Mysticist school, composed of those who are masters of binding lesser Djinn into common objects such as lamps, ropes, and carpets, making them into powerful enchanted items and servants.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_desert_spirit	Called by many names – Desert Spirits, Sand Djinn, Dust Devils, and many more – these elemental nature spirits represent the ever-changing and timeless nature of the desert, able to choke their unfortunate enemies with clouds of smoke and sand and smash them into the ground with fists made of densely packed dust. Woe betide those who anger the spirit of the desert itself!	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_desert_spirit_ror	Khar-mel is a rare and ancient Royal Djinn of Araby. She can take the form of an alluring woman, a dust cloud, or a fire pillar, depending on her mood and purpose. She is sought after by many magic-users for her vast knowledge of secrets and lore, as well as her mastery over elemental magic, for she can wield any kind of spell with ease. She can also bestow curses or blessings with the force of nature, and her presence inspires fear in her enemies.\\n\\nKhar-mel is one of the few remaining Royal Djinn – elemental spirits of great might, worshipped as demi-gods – and she has witnessed the rise and fall of the ancient Nehekharans, the colonies of the High Elves, and many other empires. She has also witnessed countless wars and cataclysms and knows many things long forgotten by mortal men. She is curious and adventurous and enjoys exploring the world and learning new things.\\n\\nKhar-mel has been known to join those who fight to defend Araby from threats that would harm the desert, for she is, in a certain way, a spirit of the land itself. She is loyal to those who earn her respect, but she will not tolerate betrayal or insult.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_fire_efreet	Known variously as Fire Efreets or Flame Spirits, these Djinn represent the tempestuous, unpredictable, and savage nature of fire itself. They are kept in pots of powdered sulphur and dry Naphtha, to both appease the spirit and contain its scorching material body. When unleashed, they take malicious glee in setting fire to those they are directed upon, taking various shapes such as giant humanoids made of flame, walking volcanoes, and enormous heads of burning lava. Fire Efreets are among the most difficult Djinn to control, and many an unprepared sorcerer has found a flaming death at the hands of these elemental spirits.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_fire_efreet_ror	The Sultan of Flames is one of the three Royal Djinn revered by the Cult of the Djinn as demi-gods and rulers of their pantheon. The Sultan of Flames is the most fearsome and colossal Efreet in the known world, a being of pure fire and fury. With a deafening roar, the Sultan of Flames is said to emerge from the depths of the earth, unleashing a blaze that surpasses the sun’s heat. In a relentless surge of fire and smoke, the Sultan of Flames roams the land, leaving a trail of destruction and ash behind.\\n\\nThe Sultan of Flames has taken various shapes over the years, from a two-headed spirit to a gigantic walking mass of magma. It is said that his wrath is unmatched and that no one can withstand the unstoppable fire of this creature. His legendary might is so great that he is worshipped as a war-god by the desert nomads of Araby.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_genie	Djinn is the name given to the spirits of the elements that dwell in the land of Araby. While many of these spirits are born from a specific element and embody it fully, others are formed from a combination of the four elements – fire, earth, wind, and water. These particular Djinn, also known as ‘Genies’, usually take humanoid shapes, from statuesque, bare-chested men to comely, voluptuous maidens, but always with their lower bodies made of shapeless smoke and skin tones of blue or purple. In battle, they are fearsome, unleashing the power of the four elements to smite their foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_giant_scorpion	Overshadowed by their abominable undead cousins, they strike equal fear into their foes who meet claw and pincer.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_giant_vulture_feral	Originating in the peaks of the Atalan Mountains of Araby, these gigantic scavenger birds were once revered as earthly avatars of the god Ualatp. When the curse of Undeath befell Ancient Nehekhara, most of the species perished, except in and around the Atalans, their original breeding grounds. The men of the nearby city of Martek, known for their penchant towards air superiority ( indeed, Martek is known for its fine magical Flying Carpets ) have long found a way to tame these ferocious animals into fearsome war beasts, striking at the enemies of Araby in a flurry of claws and beaks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_promethean_hatchlings	Reared from hatchlings these dangerous creatures would be impossible to control without the aid of magic.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_sea_nymph	Known also as Salt Devils or Oasis Sirens, the Sea Nymph is perhaps one of the most capricious and tempestuous of the Djinn of Araby. They have been known to take the form of comely men and women to lure unwary travellers into the depths of the waters they inhabit, only for their own cruel amusement. Sorcerers attempting to bind these elemental spirits into servitude must take special care in presenting the proper offerings and a vessel containing sparkling seawater for the Sea Nymph to accept the binding spell – or else face a slow death by drowning. In battle, they are a terrible force to behold, using the might of the ocean to sweep away their foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_sea_nymph_ror	The Sea-Monarch is one of the 4 Royal Djinn, considered rulers of all genies. She has supreme authority over the sea-nymphs. She can cause enormous waves and storms, and she rises from the sea when the weather is turbulent. She glows with a marine radiance, and the sea animals cower before her. The Sea-Monarch can change her appearance depending on her mood, she can look like a gorgeous woman clothed in water, with strong arms and colossal size. Or she can become a dreadful female warrior, with deadly armaments of ice. She is worshipped and dreaded by the sailors and pirates of Araby, who know her legend well. She is a living force of nature, and no one can truly control her.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_tempest_djinn	Also known as Raging Zephyrs or Whirlwind Dervishes, the Tempest Djinn is by far one of the most common types of Djinn found in Araby, especially the lesser kind, whose limited intelligence and ability to fly make them the best choice to be bound into enchanted objects such as living ropes or flying carpets. The more powerful kinds of Tempest Djinn are far more dangerous, for they take the shape of billowing clouds or living storms, ready to unleash thunder and lightning upon the object of their fury. Tempest Djinn prefer copper receptacles to inhabit, with an offering made to the Four Winds to appease them beforehand.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_tempest_djinn_ror	The Raging Tempest is one of the Royal Djinns, masters of their kind and demi-gods to the people of Araby. He is the lord of the winds, whose might can unleash devastating hurricanes that make any realm quake in fear.\\n\\nThe Raging Tempest is the most dreaded and revered of the Air Djinns; the seafarers of Araby bring his effigies with them to appease his great fury and ask for safe winds on their sails. Tales tell of his manifestations amid gales and cyclones and of how a dreadful blight emerges from his winds, wiping out all living things around him.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_cav_waghzen	The Waghzen, strange inhabitants of the jungles and savannas of the deep Southlands, are the subject of much scholarly debate regarding their origin. Theories range from dour Imperial remarks about Chaos taint, to suggestions of a local offshoot of Orc or Ogre, to more exotic notions of civilisations predating the Old Ones.\\n\\nWhatever the case, the Waghzen keep their secrets close to their chests. Their society is primitive but organised, with tribal units formed around the oldest female of the tribe. They often raid human Southlander or Arabyan settlements for food, though they are also willing to trade – even if the pompous nobility of Araby turn their noses at their 'barbarity'. Still, they will often march to war with them for the right price.\\n\\nThey are known – and feared – for their successful domestication of the terrible Hippopotami, or 'River Horses', of the Southlands. These creatures are monstrous in their own right, and the Waghzen ride them into battle armed with clubs made from gigantic bones and their considerable strength.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_war_elephant_ror_1	The Ravager of El-Kalabad (also known as the End of Cities or the Mountain-That-Walks) is a unique, grotesquely large, and mutated elephant of legend that roams the savannas of the Southlands. One-eyed and easily dwarfing all other elephant species – indeed, some say that the Ravager is more closely related to the Chaos-tainted mammoths of Norsca – the Ravager has long been considered an unstoppable force of nature by the men of the Southlands and a terrible god of destruction by the superstitious Waghzen.\\n\\nIt wasn’t until recently that the clever natural philosophers of El-Kalabad managed to subdue and control the beast with the aid of a local cabal of sorcerers.\\n\\nThe El-Kalabids are expert fortress builders, and as such, they have built a fortress howdah tower on top of the creature, crewed by the elite guard of Sultan Malik of El-Kalabad and topped by a strange artefact that can focus sunlight into a deadly beam of energy – derived from the writings and drawings of Ibn Jellaba’s journey through the realm of the Lizardmen of the Southlands.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_war_elephant_ror_2	Who first came up with the idea of using the fearsome elephant as a beast of war is a point of contention between the Sultans of Araby and the Rajas of Ind. Indeed, the Gajnal Juggernaut – a most infamous war elephant with a brass cannon mounted on its back – often deployed by the hosts of Araby, does not have its origin in the Land of Sand and Gold.\\n\\nThe Juggernaut is said to be the 'gift' of the Raja of Gajnal, ruler of one of the many kingdoms of the land of Ind. When an Arabyan mercantile delegation told the Raja about the many elephants in his Sultan’s army, the ruler of Gajnal let out a huge laugh and told his servants to bring out his 'lamest runt of an elephant' as a gift to the liege of the Arabyan delegation.\\n\\nThis 'runt' was a magnificent creature – clean, with polished tusks – and, more importantly, with an elaborate brass cannon mounted on its back, forged by the expert metalworkers of Ind to resemble one of the fearsome creatures of their homeland.\\n\\nTo this day, the truth of the Juggernaut’s origin is carefully guarded by the Arabyans, who tend to get rather nervous when foreigners point out that there’s no 'Gajnal' on any map of Araby.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_nomad	The Hashishin are a secretive Arabyan sect of infiltrators and spies with clandestine and inscrutable objectives. Recruiting from all social strata, their only requirement is a fervent desire for vengeance against those who have wronged them. They often strike in broad daylight and in public, as if to send a message, seemingly choosing their targets at random. The truth is that their targets are not random at all – they are often enemies of the people of Araby: foreign crusaders, Chaos cultists, necromancers, and cruel nobles. All those who think themselves above justice shall meet their end at the poisoned blades of the Hashishin.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon to see them march alongside the armies of Arabyan lords deemed righteous by the sect, lending their considerable talents in battle. Armed with sharp shamshirs, wrist-mounted crossbows capable of firing poisoned darts, and great athletic skill, they strike swiftly and silently against the enemies of justice.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_sheikh	The rulers of Araby go under a multitude of grandiose titles – Sheikh, Sultan, Khediv, Bey, Malik, Nizam, and many others – and often possess equally grandiose riches and egos. Indeed, it is said that the richest man in Marienburg would be the poorest Sheikh in Al Haikk, and the truth is not far from this. The fabulous wealth that courses through the port cities of Araby makes its rulers rich almost effortlessly. While this has given the nobility of Araby (both domestically and abroad) a reputation for decadence and softness, this is often the envy of lesser men speaking.\\n\\nMany are enlightened rulers who invest their wealth in public works and art patronage; others began as shrewd traders and became merchant princes; and some raised whole empires from the sands of the desert through charisma and military acumen.\\n\\nWhatever the case, when battle comes to their doorstep, they march in a parade of wealth and pride – along with the best armies their gold can train and equip – to defend their realm at the head of the host of Araby.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_sultan_jaffar	Originally the lord of a small city-state, Jaffar managed to unite the nomadic tribes of the desert through charisma and his ability to summon powerful beings known as Djinn. Soon he had conquered the cities of Al Haikk, Copher, Martek, and Lashiek and formed the Sultanate of Araby.\\n\\nDuring his reign, slowly but inexorably, the presence of Nagash's spirit corrupted the lands around Cripple Peak further, and evil creatures once more flocked to his lair, drawn by his unwholesome presence. Such gatherings could not go unnoticed forever, and soon tales reached the ears of Sultan Jaffar that a great evil now dwelt once more in the Desolation around Cripple Peak.\\n\\nThe Skaven soon allied themselves with the new Sultan of All Araby and traded espionage and assassination services in exchange for warpstone. After several years of this arrangement, the Skaven managed to convince Jaffar that Estalia planned an attack on Araby. He then decided to invade Estalia, conquering Magritta and then laying an unsuccessful siege to the Tilean city of Tobaro. In what would become known as the Crusades, thousands of knights from the Empire and Bretonnia, as well as mercenaries from Tilea, came to support the Estalians. Within a year, Jaffar's army had been driven from Estalia, and the Sultan fought a slow battle against the pursuing crusaders as tribe after tribe grew tired of his tyranny and retreated into the desert. In 1451, Jaffar's forces were defeated by the armies of King Louis the Righteous in the Battle of Al Haikk. Now Jaffar is hell-bent on taking revenge on those who defeated him.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_vizier	Magic users have an exalted place in Arabyan society, indeed, they are often given the best education the wealth of their patrons can buy, not only in the many prestigious Magical Academies of the land, but also in more mundane matters such as natural sciences, administration, and many other endeavours, this often makes them highly sought after candidates for ministerial positions at the courts of the rulers of Araby, and the masters of the palace tend to ask and follow the council of those most experienced among their magical advisor, typically raising them to the position of Grand Vizier, foremost amongst the servants of a Sultan.\\n\\nIt is rare for a Grand Vizier not to be a sorcerer, for their knowledge in many matters, both earthly and esoteric, is too great an advantage to ignore. This all has given them quite the bad reputation as powermongers and usurpers, ready to backstab their rightful lieges, and this reputation is not completely underserved. Indeed many a Vizier has turned to the use of forbidden magics to overthrow their lords, but there are just as many examples of those who are righteous men, having lead careers of dedicated administrators and skilful politicians in faithful service to their Sultan.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_war_elephant	The dreaded Arabyan Elephant is perhaps one of the better-known creatures to march in the armies of the Sultans, forever branded in the collective memory of the Old Worlders during Araby’s invasion of the north at the time of the Crusades.\\n\\nMany of these animals have been known to be born larger, with multitudes of tusks and horns beyond their common cousins. Whether this is the result of Arabyan sorcery or simply nature taking its course, the Arabyans have domesticated these greater specimens and installed howdahs – small carriages or structures – on their backs, crewed by skilled archers who shoot at the panicking foe while the gigantic beasts trample and gore their way through enemy ranks.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_enchanted_rope	Perhaps one of the more bizarre magical constructs from the land of Araby, the Enchanted Rope is, as the name suggests, an enchanted piece of hemp rope inhabited by a lesser Air Djinn – and a particularly vicious one. The resulting construct has a sort of low cunning to it and can understand basic orders. Often, various bladed implements are tied to them, and they are used as silent assassins, posing as harmless ropes until they spring to life to strangle or cut their targets to ribbons.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for eccentric Arabyan commanders to deploy swarms of these ropes in battle. Their slithering, quick movements through the air and lithe frames make them hard targets for enemy soldiers, and their blades can turn them into a whirlwind of carnage.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_art_naphtha_thrower	One of the wondrous devices engineered by the Natural Philosophers of Araby, the original Naphtha Thrower machine was commissioned by a Sultan whose name is long lost to time. Ironically, it is his visage that decorates the famous ‘faces’ of the contraption. The Thrower holds a certain quantity of the famed Arabyan flammable alchemical mixture, Naphtha, which is expelled from the machine via an ingenious spinning-torque mechanism to devastating effect.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_art_naphtha_thrower_ror	A mad experiment by the unparalleled Djinn conjurer Shihab Ibn Alim, the Animunculus was an attempt to blend the genius of the Natural Philosophers with the might of the Djinn. With a casing made of a strange alloy of meteoric metal and brass, and many a day painstakingly spent preparing the ritual to successfully bind a powerful Fire Efreet to the receptacle, the result was all too successful.\\n\\nThe machine now moves of its own will, and, as often happens with bound Fire Efreets, it loathes being trapped in an object, giving it a murderous streak that makes it extremely unstable – prone to charging the foe in a whirlwind of white-hot metal and scalding fire. As far as Shihab himself is concerned, the Animunculus was a success.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_lancer_camel_ror	The Dread Daughters of Tariq are a sisterhood of battle-mages who swore vengeance against the Undead, especially Arkhan and his minions, who slew Tariq Al-Lahah, the father and master of their founder, Zariya bint Tariq, during the Wars of Death. Tariq was a peerless master of the Wind of Aqshy, and his daughter inherited much of his power.\\n\\nShe journeyed across Araby, gathering daughters and widows who had lost their kin to the tide of Undeath, and taught those who had the gift of magic to become hunters of the dead. Since then, the Dread Daughters of Tariq have launched many raids into the realms of Tomb Kings, Necromancers, and Vampires in their righteous crusade to cleanse the world of the blight of Undeath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_short_text_arb_djinn_carriage	The Djinn Carriages, as they are often called, are holy relics of the Cult of the Djinn, Araby’s mainstream religion. Each one of these structures is said to house thousands of the elemental spirits worshipped by the people of Araby. These relics are sometimes deployed in battle, zealously escorted by the fanatic Dervishers of the Cult. The Carriage is propelled solely by the will of the Djinn, and the raw magical power it emits serves as an anchor for allied magic-users working their spells on the battlefield. But the greatest power of the Djinn Carriage can only be unlocked by the High Priests of the Cult, who are usually seen atop the relics in battle, for only they can coax and plead with the mercurial Djinn to manifest from the Carriage onto the battlefield with devastating effect.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_inf_arabyan_guard_ror	The Black Scimitar are the elite praetorian bodyguard of Sultan Jaffar. Back when he began his conquest of Araby, he personally hand-picked the most cruel and loyal soldiers to be part of this unit, personally ensuring their devotion by executing those who showed the slightest speck of doubt in their eyes. Led by Wazar the Cruel, Commander of the Black Scimitars, they perpetrated many cruelties on the people of Estalia, only to be stopped at the Siege of Magritta when Wazar himself died, crushed by a falling statue of the Goddess Myrmidia.\\n\\nWith Jaffar’s resurrection, the Black Scimitar has been re-formed, and Wazar himself is back – though it is unknown whether he was raised alongside his master or if another ruthless warrior has taken up the mantle and name of the original Captain. Whatever the case, the Black Scimitar marches on, clad in their intimidating black-and-red armour and masked helmets, ready once more to serve Sultan Jaffar in his bid for world domination.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_art_quadballista	By far the humblest invention of the Natural Philosophers, the Arabyan Scorpions are not unlike the siege ballistas of other realms in practical terms, firing large bolt-like projectiles at high speed into enemy formations to disrupt them, as well as being effective against larger creatures vulnerable to such weapons. Their craftsmanship sets them apart from other designs, with the characteristic artistry of the Arabyan engineers and a unique firing mechanism able to discharge four projectiles before needing to reload.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_art_quadballista_ror	Devised by Dujedi ibn Kaadiq, a sorcerer from the Arabyan city of Ras-Karim who was obsessed with automatons powered by Djinn spirits, the Wondrous Cheiroballistae are Scorpion-type ballistas possessed by a Tempest Djinn. When these constructs shoot, the bolts fly as if directed by the will of the spirit inhabiting the machine, homing in on their foe with deadly accuracy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_mon_djinn_book	Often, Arabyan sorcerers make the most diminutive of Air Djinns inhabit the many books filling their libraries of knowledge for ease of access, for they need only call the name of a tome for it to find its way to the sorcerer, diligently flying through the air to their hands.\\n\\nSome of the more reckless magicians use their Djinn-animated book collections to defend themselves – much to the bemusement of their foes. Their laughter does not last long once they discover just how much a thick lore book hurts when hurled at high speed directly at their heads.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_arb_sheikh_mehmed	Mehmed the Butcher, also known as Mehmed-bey or the Black Lizard, was a loyal and ruthless general of Sultan Jaffar during the time of the Crusades. He became known as The Butcher for his cruel deeds at the Battle of Nine Jackals, where he lured a crusader army to the Oasis of Gazi, having used his sorcerer’s magic to turn the water into wine. The thirsty knights had no choice but to drink the enchanted wine, which made them and their horses lose their senses. Mehmed then unleashed his armoured camelry and swift nomads to slaughter the helpless Bretonnians. He tortured the few prisoners he took and sent one mutilated survivor to tell the tale to his fellow crusaders.\\n\\nMehmed’s death came when he tried to save Jaffar, who was besieged in the city of Al Haikk by the crusaders. He gathered a huge army and hoped to break the siege and end the Crusades. Ultimately defeated by the Duke of Aquitaine – who went on to become the infamous Red Duke, Scourge of Aquitaine – he has, like his master, returned from among the dead, ready once again to be one of Sultan Jaffar’s main attack dogs.	true
