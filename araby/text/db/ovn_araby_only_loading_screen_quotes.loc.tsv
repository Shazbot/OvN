loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_arb_jaffar_loading	Tyrannical and ambitious, Jaffar was the Sultan of Araby during the period known as the Great Crusades, where he unified Araby in a series of brutal conflicts and then, emboldened by his victories, decided to invade the Old World, occupying Estalia in its entirety. Eventually, a coalition of northern realms defeated him, and the Sultan himself was slain in battle. Rumoured to have been brought back to life and granted incredible magical powers by the machinations of Kairos Fateweaver, Jaffar has recently retaken his capital of Al Haikk, his sights set once again on expanding his rule to all corners of the world.	false

loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_arb_magus_loading		false
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_arb_magus_loading	An eccentric and eerily jolly man, the Golden Magus is a keen sorcerer and a vicious corsair. He wields considerable arcane powers thanks to his bound Djinn granting him command over powerful elemental magic. The Magus sails the seas on his equal parts pleasure cruiser and fortress ship, the Flaming Scimitar, and, despite his jocose behaviour, he is a very dangerous man. Some even whisper he’s in league with the fell powers of Chaos… all baseless rumours, of course. 	false

loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_alb_fatandira_loading		false
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_alb_fatandira_loading	A woman driven by conscience and determination, Fatandira is a ruler with noble aspirations. Descending from Scythan stock, the nomad caravan she was a part of was viciously attacked and pillaged by a bigoted mob when she was a child, in the Border Princes. This event saw her family murdered, and young Fatandira set her aims on becoming a ruler that would end this hateful cycle. Eventually arriving at the homeland of her Scythan ancestors, she was declared a reincarnation of a legendary Scythan Warrior-Queen and the prophetess of the Golden God of Numas, Tutankhanut.	false

loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_campaign_arb_araby	The exotic lands of Araby are inhabited by a people who wield sorcery and military might with equal prowess. Its fabulously wealthy rulers give patronage to the wisest scholars, the mightiest sorcerers and the most skilled artists, and their great cities and armies reflect this. Divided starkly between the refined City-Folk and the proud Nomads, Arabyan armies reflect this divide, fielding professional soldiers dressed in the finest silks for their frontlines and enlisting the aid of the cunning desert people for their ranged support. The respectful attitude towards magic in Araby means that its rulers field the most wondrous and arcane forces, from the clever magic-infused inventions of the Natural Philosophers to the mighty and terrible Djinn, dreaded spirits of great elemental powers.	false

loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_araby_lore_1		false
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_araby_lore_1	The main religion in the lands of Araby is the Cult of the Djinn, the Arabyans are very respectful of these beings, incarnations of the harsh elements that rule Araby: fire, water, wind and sand. The nature of the Djinn is unclear and diverse; most are genuine nature spirits or elementals who have inhabited the deserts of Araby long before the nomadic ancestors of its human inhabitants arrived eons ago, while others are less benign entities hiding their ruinous intentions behind a veil of benevolence. While it might seem paradoxical, Arabyans draw most of their magical might from binding these spirits to objects or foci, under the proper rituals and incantations it is considered a most sacred art of communion with the divine, and the Djinn usually agree to these rituals. But not always.	false

loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_araby_lore_2	“...above this was an opulent pleasure pavilion, a miniature palace of rose marble and satin pillows, of silver tables and tasseled lamps. Through its windows we looked with the others across a garden awash with flowers and fountains and exotic trees to an enormous palace that gleamed in the sun like a gilded sapphire. Spires and minarets rose from its every corner, and gold-pillared arcades ringed its upper storeys.”. \\n\\n- description of a palace in the Arabyan city of Ras-Karim, by Felix Jaeger	false

loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_araby_lore_3	“Djinn conjuration is rather old hat for me these days, to be honest. My tastes have drifted into more… esoteric areas. Ah, change! The only true constant in the world, or beyond it, come to that. Still, I have plenty of these urns tucked away, of varying sizes and degrees of antiquity. I am sure I can spare one, for old time’s sake.” \\n\\n- The Golden Magus to his old friend, Captain Jaego Roth	false

loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_araby_lore_4		false
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_araby_lore_4	The people of Araby see magic as just another science to be studied and measured. Thanks to their distance from the poles of the world, they are able to safely conduct many experiments that would be frowned upon in other lands. Arabyan sorcerers infuse magic and bind spirits into all sorts of objects from the trivial like household items such as animated lamps to the wondrous ones such as mighty war machines inhabited by powerful Djinn spirits. This leniency towards magic has its perils, Araby is a known haven for Chaos cultists, necromancers and all sorts of rogue wizards, a fact that troubles the righteous among its rulers and benefits those of lax morals.	false

loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_araby_lore_5		false
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_araby_lore_5	The many Sultans, Emirs and Sheikhs of Araby are fabulously wealthy. Many of the most prominent Arabyan cities are also great trade ports, importing and exporting all sorts of exotic goods such as spices, fine silks, wondrous magical items and a most reconstituting beverage known as ‘koffe’. Thanks to this wealth, even the lowliest of soldiers in the armies of the Sultans are dressed in the most flamboyant and exquisite uniforms. This has given the rulers of the Arabyan cities a reputation for decadence and foppishness, which is not entirely undeserved, even so there are just as many righteous rulers that channel their wealth into charity programs, great public works and elegant architecture for the benefit of all.	false

loading_screen_quotes_bulletpoints_ovn_araby_lore_6		false
loading_screen_quotes_description_ovn_araby_lore_6	In stark contrast with the city-folk, the desert nomads of Araby live a very ascetic and rough lifestyle. A proud folk with a strong code of honour and ancient traditions, the many nomadic clans of Araby constantly war against each other for matters of honour and control of the desert oases vital for their survival, even so, they can be steadfast allies if shown friendship and hospitality. The nomad clans will readily fight in the armies of a ruler who has proven their worth, bringing light cavalry riding fast horses descended from Ulthuan stock, cunning nomad hunters that can blend in with the desert and mighty camelry, riders of fearsome beasts that can survive the harshness of Araby’s deserts.	false
