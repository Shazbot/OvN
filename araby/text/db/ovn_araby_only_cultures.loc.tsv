cultures_frontend_description_ovn_araby	Araby is an ancient realm of Men that lies far to the south of the nations of the Old World, home to cities and savage tribes of desert nomads alike. A strange and exotic country, it is ruled by powerful sultans and desert sheikhs. It rises across vast expanses of desert, its cities are located on the Coast of Araby, to the west, and to the northern borders of the Southlands. Its merchants travel and trade extensively throughout the world, establishing trade networks that span every sea and nation. Their society is notoriously focused on commerce and piracy, both of which, carried out on a global scale, bring them fabulous wealth: their sultans and caliphs are said to be richer than the Dwarfs. This trade is carried beyond the sea thanks to its dhows, fast ships with triangular sails. They have a remarkable interest in science, medicine, and magical knowledge, and their nobles invest large sums to fund research of all kinds.\\n\\nOn many occasions, the Arabyans have tried to establish themselves outside their homes, occupying territories such as Sartosa or the Border Princes but have been pushed back each time. Perhaps it is time for a strong ruler to once again set about conquering the world for the Sultanate.	false
