2024/01/02 Shaky
- Bazzar items that buff units limited to lords
- Nerfed some agent innate skills that buff units
- Fixed 'Greddy' and 'Unfaithful' innate skills to specify Heroes not Lords

- You now get slaves from sacking settlements
- Vizier skill 'Dedicated Scholar' correctly states it buff magicians not wizards

- 'Crafted' items in the Bazzar cost 9K now instead of 10k
- 'Buy Slave Rabble' text didn't have a space between after the lord name despite having a space in the loc so I've put it onto the next line.
- Changed all loading screen art to the new one Dave made
- UI text replacements for Scythans red line skills so Slave Rabble and Pit-Figters aren't mentioned
- Added garrisons to Sartosa and Drakenhof
- Fixed Magus UI Text replaments for Tzarkans whispers

- implemented Barbo's new Djinn Carriage model
- added new 2d artwork by Partypus
-- topbar holder
-- alternate mortuary cult/grand bazaar gfx

2023/12/28 Rhox
- Added missing PJ's script from Wh2 that changes market tent depending on the category

-- flags
- Added the following skins made by Dave
-- Loading screen (Only Jaffar is using it currently)
-- New thumbnail
-- Settlement occupation image

2023/12/27 Rhox
- Added citybar made by Partypus
- Added rotated flag made by Partypus
- Added thumbnail added by Dave
- Removed ancillary_included_subcultures_tables as Wh3 doesn't use it anymore, and our mod using it on vanilla ancillaries will make these items not obtainable by other cultures 
- Changed wh_dlc03_anc_follower_beastmen_spawn_wrangler to wh2_dlc17_bst_anc_follower_battle_scarred_ungor_raider as the former gave the capacity to Beastmen which is useless to Araby
- Changed wh3_main_anc_follower_ogr_cave_painter to wh3_main_anc_follower_ogr_brewer as formed as agent_subtype requirement
- wh_main_vmp_vampire_counts culture was missing from slave-giving culture so added it in
- Changed subculture key in the slave script to from wh_main_sc_nor_norsca wh_dlc08_sc_nor_norsca and also added the Norsca culture in as Rotblood mod is using Norsca culture but with different subculture
- Added cultures from other mods to the slave victory
-- mixer_gnob_gnoblar_horde (Gnoblar; Mixu) - Ogre (Need to check whether Mixu is okay with it)
-- mixer_vmp_jade_vampires (Jade Vampire; Poljanan) - Undead  (Need to check whether Pol is okay with it)
-- mixer_nag_nagash (Nagash; Team Nagash) - Undead
-- ovn_fimir -Norsca
-- ovn_albion - Men
-- ovn_araby - Men
-- ovn_amazon - Men (Not so sure about this, they're not 'Men' but not also Lizardmen)
-- ovn_halflings  - Men
-- ovn_troll - Greenskins
- Added Araby culture to the following faction_set
-- anc_set_exclusive_skaven
-- anc_set_exclusive_lizardmen
-- anc_set_exclusive_high_elves
-- anc_set_exclusive_dark_elves
-- anc_set_exclusive_tomb_kings
-- anc_set_exclusive_vampire_counts
-- anc_set_exclusive_sc_empire
-- anc_set_exclusive_norsca
-- anc_set_exclusive_dwarfs
-- anc_set_exclusive_beastmen
-- anc_set_multi_beastmen_norsca_chaos
-- anc_set_exclusive_greenskins
-- anc_set_exclusive_wood_elves
-- anc_set_exclusive_vampire_coast
-- Due to this, now we'll get to access most of the followers via random drop. Some of them will be useless (ex: add pooled resources Araby doesn't use) if we want to avoid it, we need to make clone ancillaries. Simple but the problem is there are 236 ancillaries for the slave market, so better to not do it.
