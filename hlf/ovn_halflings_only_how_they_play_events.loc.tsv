ovn_how_they_play_hlf	[[col:help_page_link]]The Kitchen[[/col]]\\nHalflings are master cooks, and their Grand Culdron can give factionwide buffs to your faction. Cooking requires the [[col:help_page_link]]Culinary Salt[[/col]] resource you can get by using the foraging army stance or by occupying regions with the salt resource.\\n\\n[[col:help_page_link]]Restaurants[[/col]]\\nHalflings can establish resturants in foreign controlled regions. Their Master Chef agents can establish them, and they get established automatically in any region you gift to the Empire. They provide passive income and you can directly recruit new generals from regions with restaurants. Fighting in regions with restaurants gives your armies Vanguard Deployment and Lightning Strike.\\n\\n[[col:help_page_link]]Ingredient Hunts[[/col]]\\nHalflings are known to mount expeditions into foreign lands looking for new cooking ingredients. To successfully complete an ingredient hunt you'll always have to fight angry locals at the hunt's destination. The hunts are timed and you always get a new one after they expire, but you also always get a time extension to complete a hunt and change the army size requirement for a hunt by using the buttons on the Missions panel. You can establish restaurants as staging grounds for missions on far-away continents.\\n\\n[[col:help_page_link]]Empire Wizards[[/col]]\\nTo recruit Empire Wizards establish a Restaurant inside an Empire settlement that has a Wizard's Conclave. This also increases the faction wizard cap and recruitment rank.	false
