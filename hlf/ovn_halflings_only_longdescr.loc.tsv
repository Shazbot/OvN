unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_knights_kitchentable_ror	Founded by one Charlie Gutbuckett, a famous Mootland Halfing dilettante both rich and skilled wth the bow, the Knights of the Kitchen Table are a "knightly order" of Halflings formed when Charlie lost to his own father in an archery contest to solve a dispute over who would eat a particularly tasty muffin. Shamed by this outcome, Charlie recruited some other like-minded eccentric and well-to-do Halflings and formed the Knights of the Kitchen Table, a brave order of Halfling knights who would ride towards the cursed city of Mordheim in search of iced buns, sparkling drinks, wyrdstone, and riches, in that particular order. Even his brother Archie joined. The last inspiring words from his father still echo in Charlie's mind: "My son, bring us back some chocolate hob-nobs." driving him and his order of valiant knights to great deeds of legend in Mordheim and elsewhere in the Old World. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_pantry_guards_ror	The Pantry Guard are an elite fighting force composed of Halfling Cooks that are known not just for their culinary skills, but also for their fighting prowess. During peacetime, they have the most sacred duty of being the guardians of a village's pantry, which contains the food reserves of the place, and is thus as sacred as any treasure chamber or great temple to the local Halflings. While Halfling culture tolerates and even encourages a bit of "borrowing" now and then, stealing from the pantry of one's own village is considered a great offense and punishable in the worst way imaginable for a Mootlander; either permanent exile from his village, or depending on the severity of the crime, from the whole Moot, and an inter-village brawl has been started over one village's Elder accussing another village's inhabitants of stealing from their pantry. As such, the Pantry Guards are amongst the most stalwart of Halflings, handpicked by the village's Elder for their honesty and integrity. During war, they don far heavier armour than most Halflings would bother carrying, and with their pure white aprons, shining pot helmets, and gleaming polearms, they are probably the closest thing you're going to find to some kind of true honorbound knight in the Mootland.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_lords_of_harvest_ror	The 'Lords of the Harvest' as they call themselves, are one of the most prominent "Gatherer" gangs in the Halfling capital city of Eicheschatten. They are known for being troublesome miscreants and performing the most shameless acts of crime, up to stealing muffins right out of other Halfling's hands, sabotaging the communal stew pot and stealing cooling pies from the windows of unsuspecting households. They are truly a nuissance to the city. Yet, their daring nature also means that in battle, they are the most ferocious of Gatherers, charging piggyback with great speed and recklessness against their enemy. The Lords of the Harvest gang members choose to also use various kinds of blunt or bladed weapons as opposed to the more conservative mancatcher staffs of the other Gathererrs, which they consider a weapon for cowards. Each gang member is extremely loyal to each other, and each "pair" of piggybackers will form a strong partnership with each other. The Grand Council of Elders in Eicheschatten has been so far unsuccessful in rooting them out of the city, for they refuse to give out the name of their leader, but many whisper that this is due to their leader being none other than one of the many children of Hisme Stoutheart, Grand Elder and Elector Count of Mootland.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_mtl_cav_battleram_riders_0	Halfling Battle Rams are specially bred for their size, strength, and pliability. They are larger and more aggressive than most of their more common cousins, and the Mootlanders use them as something akin to heavy cavalry. Their extremely thick woolly coats make them very resistant to all kinds of pierces and slashes, and their horns are quite a formidable natural weapon. The downside to all of this is that the Battle Rams are extremely skittish animals, even after all their training, and the Halfling riders, however experienced, can easily lose control of their tempestuous mounts when scared.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_ll_battle_ram	The Halfling race has a strong natural and peculiar resistance to the corrupting nature of Chaos in all of its forms, including the Winds of Magic. This usually means that, while highly resistant to enchantments and spells, very few Halflings are born with the ability to manipulate the Winds, and even so, of those that are born with the gift of magic, few are interested in developing their talents, preferring to stay at home, at Mootland, rather than in some dusty longshanks 'Colleges of Magic'. This is not to mean that Halflings hate magic, on the contrary, wizards, especially those more prone to spectacular and showy feats of magic such as those of the Bright, Grey, and Jade orders, are very welcome in the Moot and will usually receive free meals wherever they go if they provide enough spectacle. Indeed, it's these itinerating Human wizards, through their flashy feats of magic, that will usually be able to recruit the rare Halfling with magical talent and train him in the Arts. These Halfling wizards have a natural proclivity towards the wind of Ulgu, due to their species' natural proficiency at trickery and stealth. Eventually, as Halflings tend to do, they will return to Mootland, and receive the sobriquet of "Grand Enchanters", ironically or otherwise, and use their magical talents to perform all sorts of spectacles for their fellow Halflings, and if the need arises, defend the Mootland using Ulgu's power of shadows and illusions to confound and bedazzle the Moot's foes.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_housewives	One might find it strange that Halfling housewives, those Halfling women who have chosen to remain in the Moot to perform the sacred duty of taking care of the homestead, are so commonly found marching along with Mootland armies, but the truth is that these womenfolk can be some of the most fearsome and hardened warriors the Halflings can find, for many of them not only have to herd an innumerable quantity of Halfling children, but also be able to defend themselves from a particularly verminous kind of rat-like beastmen that are usually found sneaking about Mootland's rivers, when going out to do the laundry. Indeed, the sight of their sons, brothers, and husands being hurt during battle will send these housesives into a battle frenzy, where they will bite, hack, and whack the enemy with any tool at their disposal.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_milittia_great	Normally, the Halflings are a laidback and peaceful people, and they will rarely start a fight on their own. In the direst of times, though, such as when the Moot is under attack, each village's Council of Elders will muster all available Halflings into a militia, no matter how reluctant they're to fight. Because most common halflings do not have actual weapons or armour in their homes, they will respond to the call armed and armoured with various cooking tools or farming implements.These militiamen-and indeed most Halflings - are not particularly adept or disciplined warriors, but they can always count on their race's natural stealthiness and luck to aid them in a fight.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_warden_great	The Mootland Wardens are about as professional a fighting force as you're going to find among Halfling armies. Equipped in the manner of the Imperial State Troops ( and indeed, often sent as auxiliary regiments for Imperial armies ), these Halflings are particularly adept at fighting and will defend the Moot to their last breath. They are masters at wieding the 'Fighting Fork' a weapon developed by and for Haflings, fusion of a shortsword and a fork, which the Wardens wield with extreme finesse. They also have been known to carry great Battle Tenderisers, great hammers akin to their namesake tools, which they can use to inflict grievous damage on heavily armed foes. When the tall folk joke about and laugh at such a notion as a 'Halfling warrior', the Wardens are there to serve as a painful reminder not to underestimate the Mootish folk.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_warfoot	Known to only a few ( Mainly because Glibfoot avoids the subject and has never, ever written the real facts about it in any of his famed books ), Glibfoot Volespanker used to actually be part of a rather shady party of adventurers called "Navaak's Damned". The titular Navaak was a Norscan barbarian of great stature, a worshipper of the Ruinous Powers like many of his people. Part of that party also was Calenor, an ancient Elven Warrior cursed into the form of an undead Revenant by the fell magicks of the evil Necromancer Gunther Larenscheld. Glibfoot was eventually expelled by his companions for his boastful attitude, the fact that he always found a way to take all the credit for the deeds of Navaak's Damned. and his tendency to take all the riches and magic found in the chests he opened for himself, later telling his comrades that there was nothing in them except cobwebs and dust. Nobody knows the ultimate fate of the real members of Navaak's Damned, but the world sure has heard of Glibfoot's Damned in many of Volespanker's books. In the "revised" versions of his adventures, Glibfoot himself leads the party, Navaak is "reinterpreted" into a ridiculously voluptuous Norscan barbarian woman called Ysana the Red, who is, of course, in passionate love with our "hero", and Avanar into the Dwarf slayer Gruffbeard the Grim, sworn to serve Glibfoot unto death by a life oath when our "curageous protaogonist" saved him from certain death in combat against a dragon ( this misinterpretation of the Slayer Oath greatly angers many of his Dwarf readers ). Eventually, flocks of both young and veteran Halfling wardens started following Glibfoot as his personal retinue and bodyguard, whom Glibfoot eventually christened as the new "Glibfoot's Damned", his loyal companions who would be at his side leading Mootland's armies unto many a victory and, better yet, the great feasts after those victories.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_cook	Ask any Halfling about what's most important in life and you will receive one and only one answer: Food. Indeed, such is the Mootish reverence for food that every kitchen is a temple, every cookbook contains the holy word, and every cook is a miracle worker. Indeed, when Halfling armies march to war, an entire regiment of willing Cooks will march into battle, wielding their cleavers and pots with exceptional proficiency and bravery, inspiring their fellow Halflings with the promise of a post-battle feast. Some of the most fanatical cooks will even attach pots of Hot Pot soup to a chain and spin in a dervish rage, taking the enemy with them to the grave in a whirling tornado of death and soup.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_thief	The Halfling people have no concept of "private property" since, back at home, everyone's a two-or three times removed cousin, and the act of taking something from them is just considered "borrowing", no matter how indefinite this borrowing is, neither party will usually care. This attitude has given them the bad reputation of 'thieves' among the other races, and the stereotype that the Halflings are an entire race of kleptomaniacs. While not completely untrue, there's some truth to the claims that Halflings have a natural talent for thievery and stealth. In times of war, these 'borrowers' will be forcefully recruited into Halfling armies. Some of these regiments have been known to somehow steal their foes' armour and weapons from under them during battle.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_cook_ror	The Great Cauldron is the biggest cooking pot in Mootland, situated right at the center of Eicheschatten, and it is where the most talented cooks and master chefs show off their culinary talent during Cock Festival, one of the most important holiday weeks ( of which there are plenty ) in Mootland's calendar. Those cooks that prove their worth in this contest are recruited in times of war into a special culinary operations regiment known as the Grand Cauldron Cooks. Reverently followed as a beacon of Halflingness, these cooks will inspire incredible deeds in their fellow Mootlanders, if not for their awesome cooking prowess, then for the surely delicious feast they will personally prepare after the battle.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_moot_general_0	Far from being a formal title, "Moot Generals" are usually Halflings of great importance in Mootlander society, around which all Halflings will rally in times of war. These are usually Elders or other statemen of the Moot, but they can also be popular figures, such as eating contest winners, famous Halfling adventurers, someone's really well-connected cousin, and veteran Moot Wardens. Halfling commanders do not direct their armies with the pomp and authority that Human, Elven and Dwarfen generals would, but usually through their charisma and, more commonly, the promise of a ( or more than one ) good after-battle feast. Because most Moot Generals are well-off halflings, they usually go to battle in the finest weapons and armour a Mootlander can afford, as well as ride any mount they choose to battle on, from the dreaded Battle Swans to the legendary Cockatrices.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_master_chef_0	Ask any Halfling about what's most important in life and you will recieve one and only one answer: Food. Indeed, such is the Mootish reverence for food that every kitchen is a temple, every cookbook contains the holy word and every cook is a miracle worker. Nowhere is this truer than amongst the Master Chefs, mythical Halfling cooks with legendary cookery abilities. These Masters of the Gastronomical Arts often have the privilege of being some of the most ladued figures of Halfling society, and in times of war, one accompanying an army is a sign of incoming post-batle feasts, which greatly motivates any Mootland army. but even on the battlefield, their Art of Cooking can affect the course of battle, with their food having the ability to literally raise the dead, hinder the foe with it's enticing smell, and damage the enemy in great explosions of scalding soup. The Halfling army not only marches on it's stomach, it fights on it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_sheriff_0	There’s a popular saying in Stirland that goes: ‘There’s no law for Halflings’. This is usually true in the broad sense, small criminal acts of personal slights are easily forgotten for the laidback folk of the Mootland, and it is usually the Sheriffs who are tasked by each Village's Council of Elders to mediate in any serious disputes, which usually end in restitutions in coin or trade goods, though if any unsavory visitors like to take Stirlander claims about the Halfings literally, and start commiting any grevious criminal acts - such as wanton murder - against the Halfling people, they will soon find themselves facing not Halfling forgiveness, but what in the Moot they call 'Human justice', which is usually Mootish shorthand for cruel and unusual punishment to cruel and unusual crimes. It falls to the Sheriffs, usually veterans wardens or militiamen, to hunt down, and if necessary, rally a mob of Halflings that will surely end up lynching the criminal. In times of war, the Sheriffs of Mootland will be the ones in charge of rallying the Halfling townsfolk into militias and try to organise and prepare them for war. As much as you can with Halflings anyway.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_bee_throwers	Halflings are very much in love with honey, putting it in every single thing they can fit it in, from biscuits to pies to ales to even porridges. It is no wonder then that Mootland boasts the best beekeepers in the Empire, probably even in the whole Old World. At some point in their history, Halflings must have noticed just how nasty a swarm of angry bees could be (no wonder during early attempts at beekeeping gone awry), and now those same expert beekeepers who carefully take care of their hives and extract the honey also provide their talents on the battlefield, where they will throw entire hives of bees at the foes of Mootland, with nasty results. After all, not even the most embattled of warriors can stand a beeswarm getting under their armour.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_milittia_arch	If there's one martial art where all Halflings truly excel, it's archery. Indeed, Halflings have an unusually keen sight, and will often prefer to fight from a distance to compensate for their obvious physical drawbacks. Regiments of Mootish archers are greatly appreciated as auxiliary soldiers in Imperial armies, with Imperial Generals going so far as to turn a blind eye to the random acts of petty thievery that pop up whenever Halflings are around, just to be able to use the excellent talents of their Halfling auxiliaries in archery and guerilla warfare.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_archer	If there's one martial art where all Halflings truly excel, it's archery. Indeed, Halflings have an unusually keen sight, and will often prefer to fight from a distance to compensate for their obvious physical drawbacks. If there's one fighting force among the Halflings that has perfected bowmanship, it's the Mootland Scouts, a respected force both in their homeland, and, surprisingly for a Halfling military unit, elsewhere in the Empire, where they are highly priced as skirmishers and for their ability to constantly harass enemy forces. The Mootland Scouts only accept the best and most sneaky of Halflings into their ranks, and they are usually a nasty surprise to whatever evil force tries to slip into the Moot unnoticed.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_cock	Lumpin Croop's Fighting Cocks: Now there's a name renowned across the Old World. Hailing from an unimportant village in northern Mootland, and son of the blacksmith's daughter and a roaming carrot salesman, Lumpin never met his father, who tragically choked on a horseshoe in a most tragic accident. Young Lumpin was greatly disliked by his grandparents, and his bright orange hair only reminded them of the licentious carrot salesman that had defiled their poor daughter, and spent years being forced to work on his grandfather's forge. Unsurprisingly, Lumpin ran away from home as soon as he was able, and fell into a life of petty crime ( which is not really all that bad a fate for a Halfling ). At some point, he became an excellent poacher with a sharp sight, especially during the night, and after a few stolen hunts too many, Lumpin found himself fabricating the most ridiculous story about how he was actually looking for warriors to join him on a quest into the mythical lands of the rich Merchant Princes of Tilea in front of a whole tavern of drunk Halflings, and after a couple more drinks, the whole tavern decided to follow him into this land of adventure and riches under the flag of a new band, Lumpin Croop's Fighting Cocks. From that day on, Lumpin has tried to sneak away at any chance or to misdirect the band away from Tilea, but his comrades always end up finding him, and they insist that these are secret "training exercises" meant to put them to the test, their faith in Lumpin's great adventure unshakable. The truth is that these "training exercises" have formed the Fighting Cocks into an elite force of skirmishers and bowmen, honing the natural talents of Halflings for stealth and archery. This has made them ridiculously rich in the tumultuous Tilean lands, and Lumpin himself is learning to live his change in fortunes the best he can: always devising new "training exercises" away from the battlefield in his personal tent.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_fieldwarden_0	Though most will surely laugh at this claim, the Mootland Fieldwardens are one of the most lethal fighting forces in the Old World. The Fieldwardens have no named regiments, no uniforms, and few leaders. They are fiercely loyal, cunning and dogged, and are all veteran volunteers in many conflicts. Much of their success comes from the fact that they know the Moot. They not only know every twig and brush like the back of their hands, they know the people intimately and are usually related to them. This allows them to act as  snipers and guerrilla warriors. The Fieldwardens also remain vigilant by having a tight focus: they don’t care for any lives that aren’t Mootlander Halflings. Ogres can take care of themselves, Stirlanders and Averlanders are probably up to no good, and any Human coming from the east is more than likely undead (or worse). Visitors who expect help from local authorities will be laughed at. The Fieldwardens protect their own—no more, no less.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_glibfoot	Glibfoot Volespanker, famed Halfling adventurer, writer, warrior, rogue, treasure-hunter, Master of the 16 Meals, Grand Eater of the Feast of the 5000 courses, Avatar of Hyacinth, Ardent Paramour of Esmeralda, Master & Commander of Glibfoot's Damned, and Scourge of Orcs & Goblins. Many are the titles and deeds Glibfoot will claim to have accomplished, and few in the Moot ( and beyond ) do not become enraptured with his heroic tales, either when he actively boasts about them in taverns and pubs all over the land, or when any of his many autobiographical novels, such as 'Hard in Hochland', 'Glibfoot's Guide to Adventuring' and 'Me and the Hag Queen: A Salacious Story", Many, both inside and outside the Moot will say he's nothing but a two-bit scrbibbler and a charlatan, yet how can these naysayers explain his array of magical items, such as his magical elven blade or his enchanted druchii crossbow? Such is Glibfoot's prowess and popularity, that Grand Elder Hisme Stoutheart has placed him in command of Mootland's armies, or whatever passes for the Halfing military anyway. Time will tell whether Glibfoot has bitten off more than he can chew and must rely on his deception and charisma to stay afloat, or if he truly is a Hero of the Moot...	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_mtl_cav_swan_riders_0	Though less imposing at first sight than their Great Eagle cousins, the Mootland's Giant Swans can be a terrifying sight to behold in the battlefield, especially when ridden by the best bowmen the Mootland has to offer.Highly aggressive, these giant birds will kill anything they perceive as a threat with their powerful wings and the deadly bite of their beaks. How the Halflings ever came to tame these nasty-tempered creatures as mounts for battle remains a mystery, but it sure took many attempts and many lost facial features to get the procedure right. To this day, only the bravest and most daring Mootland Scouts will attempt to venture into the ponds of the Mootland and tame one of these legendary creatures, which they will then ride to war with.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_mtl_veh_reaper	Unsurprisingly, farming is seen as a great and worthwhile endeavor in the Moot. A large portion of the population works hard on the fields of their idillic countryside ( no matter what lies the grim and envious Stirlanders like to spread about Halflings being all lazy louts), and the Halflings have become true masters in the realm of agriculture. The rest of their technology might be years behind the rest of the world, with nothing more complicated than water-powered mills, but their ingenuity when it comes to agriculture is outstanding. One of the results of their advancements in farming technology is the Reaper, a special kind of plough with a sharp rotating blade, used to quickly collect the crops that are ripe for recollection, over time though, a lot of Halfling farmers have also started to use it to fend off attackers away from their fields, and it "reaps" enemy heads just as well, especially those of smaller stature like goblins or the verminous rat-like beastmen that inhabit many of the Mootland's rivers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_half_pig	Anyone who has seen the Mootland's armies in action will give credence to the common claim, usually jocously made, that the Halflings bring the farm to the battlefield. These jokesters should probably take this as less of a lark and more as a warning, for one of the most terrifying sights to behold on the battlefield is a herd of maddened and enraged farm pigs. Driven forward by the bravest of Halfling farmers, these animals will trample and likely bite and devour those unfortunate enough to fall under their charge.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_hlf_baby_dragon	Though the Halflings are generally laidback, friendly, and merry people, they seem to have a certain animosity towards dragons. No one knows how it started, but there are some weird fringe theories about their kinship with the Ogre race and how both they and the Halflings were forced to move away from their homeland in the East by a giant meteor summoned from the skies by the caste of Celestial Dragons ruling the realm of Grand Cathay. Whatever the case, and much to the disgust of the High Elves of Ulthuan, some undoubtedly brave Halflings have managed to steal dragon eggs, somehow. Usually they are boiled and eaten, but occasionally a dragon hatchling emerges from them, and the Mootanders, cunning as ever, will train these creatures both as entertainment animals and war beasts, and force them to march to battle. Though not as developed as the larger specimens of their race, these "baby dragons" are still quite strong in battle, they are even able to breathe a weaker form of an adult dragon's fire breath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_hlf_roast_pig	Though some Halflings will say that there's no better thing after battle than a feast, the truth is that they will also welcome it during one. Indeed, in some Mootlander armies, some specially dedicated cooks have been known to prepare delicious feasts and carry them to battle as if they were the holiest of relics. And they might as well be, because the Halflings surrounding it will guard the tasty dish with their very lives, with the added incentive of being able to take a bite off it between sword stabbings and arrow shootings. If the feast were to be lost to the enemy though, it would be a great morale hit for the whole Halfling army. There's nothing worse than having to watch as your enemy eats ( and if it's those tasteless Bretonnians, defiles with their dull spices ) your tasty feast. Even death is preferable.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_elo_supply_wagon	Chuck Wagons are, for all purposes, the battle standards of the Halfling army. Full of tasty meats, cheese, food, ale, wine, and whatever other rations the Mootlanders carry with their army, these carts are indeed very dear to all Hallfing soldiers. It is pulled by a wild and ancient breed of cattle known as aurochs, which are both nasty in battle and tasty in the pot. It is usually driven by expert cooks who will tactically deploy food dishes, ammunition, and whatever else is necessary to bring victory to the armies of the Moot. They also carry barrels of the famous Halfling tobacco leaves, and in a pinch, they can burn some of the contents to form a thick smoke screen which will blind any foe ( but not the Halflings themselves, they are quite used to tobacco smoke ).	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_sr_ogre	Nobody can deny that there is a strange bond between the Ogre and Halfling races. Indeed, the lumbering creatures from the Mountains of Mourn display a natural tendency towards forming friendships with the Mootlanders, and a certain protective attitude towards them. Not only because the Halflings prepare the best meals an Ogre could ask for.Indeed, a large community of Ogres has taken root in the Moot, a development not totally unwelcome by the locals, since the Halflings also seem to have a natural aptitude for talking the Ogres into performing various tasks for them ( the tasty food also helps ), as if they were two halves of the same people. Ogres, though, no matter how friendly they are to the smallfolk, will find a medium-rare haunch of halfling quite a delight when they are truly hungry.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_sr_ogre_ror	The Feastmaster Tribe of Ogres has their home in the foreboding Dark Lands, and is known for "forcefully employing" Halflings in place of the Ogre's usual Gnoblar underlings, after their Tyrant captured a few of them during his raids into the Empire. Even though they are harsh masters, the Ogres are unable to treat Halflings as cruelly as they would Gnoblars.This could be due to the fact that Halflings can cook magnificent feasts, and that Tyrant Glaut of the Feastmaster is particularly bright and forward-thingking, for an Ogre, and as such, prefers to keep the little folk around, rather than eat them ( this is not to say that some have accidentally ended up "in the trough"). In 2502 IC, during the Revolt of the Moot against Mad Count Marius Leitdorf's crazed attempt to exterminate the Mootlander Halflings, the Elders of Mootland sent for aid to various Halfling communities, including the ones living under Glaut Feastmaster. Surprisingly, not only the Halfligns under the tribe, but also the Ogres and their Tyrant anwsered the call, finding that they couldn't find it in their hearts to let their precious little cooks become extinct. After the battle against Count Leitdorf and the subsequent feast, many Feastmaster Ogres decided to remain in Mootland. For this, Tyrant Glaut "exiled" them, from their tribe's land back in the Dark Lands, but these Ogres seemed quite happy with the predicament of being exiled in such a land of bountiful food as the Moot. Ever since, these Ogres have marched alongside Halflings armies in times of war to defend their smallfolk friends, for whom they are awfully protective. In battle, they wield a weapon known as the "Hot-Pot on a Stick," a giant staff with a pot filled with the famously acidic Hot-Pot Soup attached to its pot. Besides it being a strong blunt weapon thanks to the natural strength of the Ogres, it also drenches the enemy in the Hot-Pot concoction ( which also makes the Ogres really want to eat the scalded enemies as a "battlefield snack" ).	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_halfling_cat_ror	The Hot-Pot Chucker is a proposed "upgrade" to the Hot-Pot Catapults used by Halfling Cooks to fling the deadly Hot Pot soup recipe at their foes. This new design is partly based on recovered Goblin contraptions, and as such, many Elders have a certain dislike for this innovation. Only a couple of "prototypes" have ever been made, and they are rarely deployed, because most Moot Generals consider the Hot-Pot Catapults the obvious superior choice. Whatever the case, they actually do fling the Hot-Pot projectiles a bit further away than the catapult design, at the cost of mobility.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_wh_main_mtl_veh_soupcart	What hasn't been already said about the famous "Kathleen" Soup Tank ? How the Halflings came into possession of one of the lost Steam Tanks is a mystery, but the ingenious inhanbitants of the Moot didn't find the clunky war machine appealing to their sensibilities, so they modified it to make it more "homely". The main cannon, that loud and barbaric tall folk weapon, was removed, and a clever contraption that could fire gouts of the famed Hot-Pot soup recipe was installed on a separate wooden cart that the steam engine would then pull into battle. The Kathleen saw its greatest moment during the "Revolt of the Moot", a battle caused by the reckless behaviour of the Mad Count of Averland, Marius Leitdorf, in 2502 IC. Count Leitdorf had, with the approval of Mootland's Great Council of Elders, intended to build a modern stone bridge over the River Stir, and sent a contingent of engineers to start the construction. Each night, after the work shift was done, materials vital for construction would disappear. The situation reached a boiling point when the Mad Count accused the whole Halfling race of thievery and ordered his personal armies to start a campaign of extermination against the people of Mootland. Horrified by this, the Elders of Mootland raised an army of Halfling militia to retaliate against Leitdorf's atrocities. The army of the Moot was quickly put down by Averland's more professional soldiers, and the Elders of the Moot went into hiding, frantically sending messengers with pleas of help to various friends of Mootland, a plea asnwered only by Lumpin Croop, the famous Halfling mercenary, and Tyrant Blaut of the Feastmaster Ogres. It was during this climactic battle that the Kathleen was first deployed, and, with the aid of the Feastmaster Ogres and Croop's mercenaries, managed to break the Mad Count's army. After this humilliating defeat, Leitdorf himself would later face the Emperor's justice, for a Reiklander army had been dispatched by Karl Franz himself to bring him to book. Since this glorious victory, the Kathleen Half-Tank has been an integral part of any army raised in defense of the Moot, and is generally seen as a sign of good luck by the smallfolk of Mootland.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_mtl_art_hotpot	Originally a Halfling cook's desperate attempt to defend their homestead against an oncoming Goblin attack, the famous Hot-Pot Catapult has become a bit of an institution among the armies of the Moot. As such, the original unknown inventor of the catapult used some leftovers and a rudimentary knowledge of ballistics to propel a deadly pot full of a scalding liquid that horrifically burned and scared the oncoming Goblin raiding party, and so the legend of the Hot-Pot Catapult spread amongst the Halfling cooks, each making their own unique Hot-Pot recipe for use in battle (and, of course, as food, only for the most daring Halflings who like a little extra spice in their diet). As such, the ingredients that make up this soup are a closely guarded secret, and vary wildly from cook to cook. If there's no cook available, it can be used to throw boiling oil, but the Hot-Pot Soup is always more successful at routing and causing mayhem amongst the enemy, for this corrosive liquid will cling to and penetrate armour and melt the flesh beneath it. It is said that even the dreaded Chaos Warriors of the Northern Wastes fear the scalding touch of the Hot-Pot Soup, and for good reason.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_mtl_art_hotpot_ror	The Great Cauldron is the biggest cooking pot in Mootland, situated right at the center of Eicheschatten, and it is where the most talented cooks and master chefs show of their culinary talent during the Cock Festival, one of the most important holiday weeks ( of which there are plenty ) in Mootland's calendar. During these festivities, the most famed master chefs of the Moot will compete to see who has the best Hot-Pot recipe, with the winner's recipe being used in the Grand Cauldron Hot-Pot Catapult, crewed by the best and most accurate Halfling artillerymen, if one can think of such a thing as that.	true

Loudly and rudely shouting from atop their squealing mounts and hitting the enemy with their farm tools and cudgels, these Halflings make for an effective, if unorthodox, harassing force of "light pigalry". Also, as an added incentive, if the mount is ever hurt, well, it would be a waste for all this nice meat to go to waste, wouldn't it?	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_moot_general_2	Far from being a formal title, "Moot Generals" are usually Halflings of great importance in Mootlander society, around which all Halflings will rally in times of war. These are usually Elders or other statemen of the Moot, but they can also be popular figures, such as eating contest winners, famous Halfling adventurers, someone's really well-connected cousin, and veteran Moot Wardens. Halfling commanders do not direct their armies with the pomp and authority that Human, Elven and Dwarfen generals would, but usually through their charisma and, more commonly, the promise of a ( or more than one ) good after-battle feast. Because most Moot Generals are well-off halflings, they usually go to battle in the finest weapons and armour a Mootlander can afford, as well as ride any mount they choose to battle on, from the dreaded Battle Swans to the legendary Cockatrices.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_master_chef_1	Ask any Halfling about what's most important in life and you will recieve one and only one answer: Food. Indeed, such is the Mootish reverence for food that every kitchen is a temple, every cookbook contains the holy word and every cook is a miracle worker. Nowhere is this truer than amongst the Master Chefs, mythical Halfling cooks with legendary cookery abilities. These Masters of the Gastronomical Arts often have the privilege of being some of the most ladued figures of Halfling society, and in times of war, one accompanying an army is a sign of incoming post-batle feasts, which greatly motivates any Mootland army. but even on the battlefield, their Art of Cooking can affect the course of battle, with their food having the ability to literally raise the dead, hinder the foe with it's enticing smell, and damage the enemy in great explosions of scalding soup. The Halfling army not only marches on it's stomach, it fights on it.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_sheriff_1	There’s a popular saying in Stirland that goes: ‘There’s no law for Halflings’. This is usually true in the broad sense, small criminal acts of personal slights are easily forgotten for the laidback folk of the Mootland, and it is usually the Sheriffs who are tasked by each Village's Council of Elders to mediate in any serious disputes, which usually end in restitutions in coin or trade goods, though if any unsavory visitors like to take Stirlander claims about the Halfings literally, and start commiting any grevious criminal acts - such as wanton murder - against the Halfling people, they will soon find themselves facing not Halfling forgiveness, but what in the Moot they call 'Human justice', which is usually Mootish shorthand for cruel and unusual punishment to cruel and unusual crimes. It falls to the Sheriffs, usually veterans wardens or militiamen, to hunt down, and if necessary, rally a mob of Halflings that will surely end up lynching the criminal. In times of war, the Sheriffs of Mootland will be the ones in charge of rallying the Halfling townsfolk into militias and try to organise and prepare them for war. As much as you can with Halflings anyway.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_com_cha_olorin_the_grey_wizard_0	The Comradeship is an allegedly elite club, to which only the prestigious and powerful may be given access. In reality, all of its "members" are a bunch of ne'er-do-wells, vagrants, and exiles with some faint heroic aspirations. Olorin is the self-proclaimed leader of the Comradeship ( for all the good it does to him ), and is apparently a petty wizard, a grimey vagrant, and a barely graduated member of the Grey Order. All this is a clever ruse, for he is an agent of the Grey Guardians, and the Comradeship is a covert operation set up by the Grey Order to recruit and teach all Halflings with possible magical talent, who usually have a natural proclivity towards Ulgu, to their order, to tip the political balance of the Colleges in favour of their own order. He uses simple parlor tricks and some "borrowed" Cathayan fireworks to entertain and impress any potential candidates. What 'Olorin' ( which might not even be his real name ) didn't expect was that the Comradeship would attract all kinds of fellow grimey vagrants and failed exiles, with all the problems that entails, and that trying to organise and instruct the locals in the arts of magic is like herding cats. Nevertheless, the Halflings have taken a liking to him, and the Comradeship under his 'leadership', whatever its original purpose, has managed to perform enough heroic feats in defence of the Mootland to earn love and trust from the smallfolk.	true

In reality, all of its "members" are a bunch of ne'er-do-wells, vagrants, and exiles with some faint heroic aspirations. Aragand is the kind of bloke you'd find in any tavern in the Empire, alone, unloved, and extremely drunk. Except this drunk claims to be the last rightful heir of a 'kingdom' somewhere in the Borderlands, which even if it were true ( and they likely aren't, it just takes smelling his breath to find out why ), would likely mean that he's the oh-so-great-monarch of some pile of manure with a flag planted on it, as Border Princedoms tend to be. He rambles and rambles about his lost kingdom, especially when drunk ( and he's never sober ), that his broken sword is proof of his heritage, that the black tree heraldry in his poorly maintained armour marks him as a member of the royal family of a 'kingdom' he can barely pronounce the name of ( all that fellow members of the Comradeship can make out is 'Gonnad', 'Ghonrrea' or 'Glandior' ). When in battle, he fights with drunken abandon in a style that was allegedly taught to him by an eastern master of such alcoholic martial arts, and he is a surprisingly effective warrior, most probably due to a sort of drunkard's luck. Only Olorin takes his claim seriously, and has been trying to get Aragand sober just once, in order to find the truth, if there's any, behind this drunkard's ramblings.	true

Legles could probably be the most competent member of the Comradeship if he didn't spend most of his time engaging in pranks and playing all sorts of tricks with his fellow members. Finding Asrai society too boring and constricting, this fervent follower of Loen the Trickster wandered out of Athel Loren and eventually ended up in Mootland, where his carefree attitude and impish nature endeared him to the Halflings, who are always up for a good lank. On a fateful morning, he was "forcefully befriended" to a failed Dwarf slayer known as Giblit during his morning constitutional, and ever since, Giblit has been the number one source of Legles' entertainment and the number one target of all his pranks.	true

In reality, all of its "members" are a bunch of ne'er-do-wells, vagrants, and exiles with some faint heroic aspirations. Giblit used to be your typical Dwarf Slayer, a grim individual determined to die fighting the most terrible beasts possible. However, one fateful day, while fighting a terrible dragon, he found himself fleeing and eventually befriending the beast; when his fellow slayers discovered this, they removed all his tattoos honoring the gods, instead tattooing on him runes with meanings such as "stupid" or "elf-like," and, as punishment, they forcefully carried him over to the peaceful land of the Moot, where he would never find a worthy foe to die in combat.The humilliation didn't end there, for as his ultimate penance, he was forced to swear an oath where he would have to befriend a nearby elf that was casually taking his morning constitutional, whether he liked it or not. Ever since, Giblit and Legles have been inseparable friends, and Giblit's time in the Mootland ( and its food ) has made him want to live again, renounce his Slayer oath and take up a new oath to defend the land of the Halflings as part of the Comradeship.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_mtl_cav_poultry_riders_0	The Giant Cockarel has always been the beloved symbol of Mootland and of all Halflings. Standing hard and proud, while also being a tasty source of food, from its eggs to its breasts and legs, it represents everything all Halflings stand for. A distant, domesticated cousin to the dreaded Culchans of Lustria, there are many theories and legends about Old Worlder Halflings making contact with a lost tribe of fellow Halflings deep in the jungles of Lustria, who taught the Mootlanders the secrets of Culchan husbandry ( and many tasty ways to cook them too, which greatly interested the Old World Halflings ). Even when bred and domesticated into the Giant Cockarels, their aggressive nature never truly faded away ( Halfling Cockarel farmers can attest to this fact, with missing eyes, fingers, and even entire members severed by the beasts in fits of rage ), and in time, the Mootlander Halflings bred a special type of aggressive cockarel to be used only in battle. Woe to any foe of Mootland who faces the dreaded Cockarel Riders, for their corpsoes will soon litter the battlefield, pecked to a terrible death.	true

With the ubiquity of farm animals that accompany Halfling armies to battle, it is no wonder that eventually someone had the idea to use these mutts to better direct all the pigs, cockarels, and other farm beasts into battle. These animals are staunchly loyal to their Halfling masters, and will follow them to their death.

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_hlf_gatherers	The "Gatherers" as they like to call themselves, are bands of young delinquent Halflings, eager to get into all sorts of mischief and trouble. Even among the naturally impish Halflings, these young ones cross the line all too often. They will accompany Halfling armies to battle, whether the Moot Generals like it or not, and cause all sorts of ruckus, their favourite tactic being charging piggyback, one Gatherer on top of the other, headfirst onto the enemy. Some of the more clever Halfling commanders have put the enthusiasm of these youths to good use, and trained them in the use of the "mancatcher," a tool that the Mootlanders often use when there's a necessity to catch criminal tallfolk. In battle, the daring Gatherers will use these hooked staffs to pin down the lighter enemy troops so they are an easier target for the ranged forces of the rest of the Halfling army. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_ll_swan	The Halfling race has a strong natural and peculiar resistance to the corrupting nature of Chaos in all of its forms, including the Winds of Magic. This usually means that, while highly resistant to enchantments and spells, very few Halflings are born with the ability to manipulate the Winds, and even so, of those that are born with the gift of magic, few are interested in developing their talents, preferring to stay at home, at Mootland, rather than in some dusty longshanks 'Colleges of Magic'. This is not to mean that Halflings hate magic, on the contrary, wizards, especially those more prone to spectacular and showy feats of magic such as those of the Bright, Grey, and Jade orders, are very welcome in the Moot and will usually receive free meals wherever they go if they provide enough spectacle. Indeed, it's these itinerating Human wizards, through their flashy feats of magic, that will usually be able to recruit the rare Halfling with magical talent and train him in the Arts. These Halfling wizards have a natural proclivity towards the wind of Ulgu, due to their species' natural proficiency at trickery and stealth. Eventually, as Halflings tend to do, they will return to Mootland, and receive the sobriquet of "Grand Enchanters", ironically or otherwise, and use their magical talents to perform all sorts of spectacles for their fellow Halflings, and if the need arises, defend the Mootland using Ulgu's power of shadows and illusions to confound and bedazzle the Moot's foes.	true

unit_description_historical_texts_text_unit_long_text_ovn_hlf_fieldwarden_1	Though most will surely laugh at this claim, the Mootland Fieldwardens are one of the most lethal fighting forces in the Old World. The Fieldwardens have no named regiments, no uniforms, and few leaders. They are fiercely loyal, cunning and dogged, and are all veteran volunteers in many conflicts. Much of their success comes from the fact that they know the Moot. They not only know every twig and brush like the back of their hands, they know the people intimately and are usually related to them. This allows them to act as  snipers and guerrilla warriors. The Fieldwardens also remain vigilant by having a tight focus: they don’t care for any lives that aren’t Mootlander Halflings. Ogres can take care of themselves, Stirlanders and Averlanders are probably up to no good, and any Human coming from the east is more than likely undead (or worse). Visitors who expect help from local authorities will be laughed at. The Fieldwardens protect their own—no more, no less.	true

Most Halflings occupying this position tend to be the older women in the local settlement, for while the Many Times Grandmother loves all her children, she favours those who share her grand-motherly role the most. Most tallfolk laugh at the concept of a Halfling god, not to mention an entire pantheon, but the truth is that these are as real as Sigmar, Ulric and the rest of the gods of Man, Elves and Dwarfs. Apart from their excellent cooking skills, which are only rivalled by Master Chefs, with whom they share a special position in Halfling society-truly the days when a Matron and a Master Chef come together to prepare a dish are greatly celebrated-they are able to call on the intervention of the Halfling Gods, who will listen to the plea of the Matron-Maestros. While the divine magic of the Halflings is not as flashy as that of other gods, it certainly is effective, for Matrons are able to call on the might of Josias, God of Husbandry, to summon a herd of trampling farm animals, or summon an avatar of Phineas, God of Tobacco, to call a noxious cloud of tobacco fumes on their enemies. Despite being seemingly feeble old women, one should not underestimate the Matrons, for the raising of plenty of chidlren and grand-children has given them a mighty temper when dealing with disrespetful and impetuous youths.	true
