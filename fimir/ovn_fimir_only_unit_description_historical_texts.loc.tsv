unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_boglar_shaman	In Boglar society ( such as it is ), the highest figure is that of the Shaman. Much like all of the other Greenskin races, Boglars are tremendously superstitious, carrying all sorts of fetishes and lucky charms that they believe grant them an edge in the dangerous bogs they inhabit. As such, they place great importance on magic. Generally, Boglar Shamans are the ones in contact with their particular tribe's Fimir overlords, who demand tribute (however meager, the Fimir do this out of a malign intention to dominate the lesser Boglars ). and Boglar slaves to join their raiding parties. Boglar Shamans draw their magic both from the marshy lands they inhabit and from the gestalt energy of their fellow Gnoblar tribesmen, allowing them to cast deadly water-based spells or a particular type of Greenskin spells similar to that of the shamans of their Goblin cousins. Despite the cruelty of their masters, the Boglars worship the Fimir as much out of fear as out of awe, and some Fimir chieftains have been known to bind Marsh Hound daemons as mounts and familiars for their most competent Boglar lackeys... provided they survive the first contact with the beast. Boglar shamans festoon themselves with all sorts of swamp fungi, thinking this helps them bring "Da Power of da Bog" with them wherever they go.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_boglar	Boglars, known variously as Marsh-Gnoblars and Swamp Goblins, are a particular variety of Gnoblars who tend to inhabit marshy places, such as bogs and swamps. Cruel as any of their cousins, their main pastime is hunting all sorts of swamp critters, to slowly dissect the animals with sticks and then eat them. With beady eyes, fin-like ears, grey-blue skin, and pointed teeth, they make for a more fearsome visage than their common Gnoblars cousins. Many Boglar tribes, especially those living near the Marshes of Madness are in alliance ( forced or otherwise ) with the cyclopean Fimir, since both races detest sunlight, with the Fimir allowing the Boglars to live under the magical mists that apear around Fimir territories. In exchange, these Boglars serve as disposable distractions when the Fimir form their raiding parties, meant to draw the enemies' attention away from the main Fimir force and tarpit swarm its foes with their numbers.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_shearl	The lowly Shearl represents what is considered the lowest caste of Fimir society, being also the most numerous of them. Weaker and smaller than the other Fimir, the Shearl are tasked mainly with maintaining their settlements. They gather, preserve, and cook the food; they fashion weapons and armour for the Fimm caste. Regardless of how crude they appear, all of their creations are functional, as anyone who has attempted to attack a Fimir stronghold can attest. They are considered thralls by the other Fimir castes and are expected to obey their every command. During war, the Mearghs or Fimm Nobles will conscript a large number of them for battle, barely armed and armoured, meant to serve as cannonfodder and to transport whatever spoil the Fimir raiding party manages to capture back to the stronghold. However dull they seem outside of battle, they become as cruel and savage as any other Fimir when fighting.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_death_quest	When the Meargh of a particular Fimir Stronghold dies without a successor, her clan will dissolve into what is known as a death-quest, formed by the clan's Fimir of all castes without distinction, with Shealrs, Fimm and Dirach marching side by side. Much like the Dwarfen Slayers, the main purpose of this "death-quest" is for its constituents to die in battle, having shamed themselves in failing to both protect their Meargh and ensure the continued existence of their clan by finding another. While the Shearl usually die faster, the Fimm and DIrach in a death-quest can live on to fight long enough that they will become wandering mercenaries, lending their efforts to destructive races such as Greenskins, Skaven and the Forces of Chaos, for no one else will accept the malign FImir among their ranks. Usually led by either a Dirach or a Fimm Noble, it's common for members of these two castes to bicker over who gets to command the death-quest to their doom.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_killing_eye	Once one of the largest and most dreaded Fimir clans, the Killing-Eye nobles and mearghs always claimed direct descent from Balor and Fimul, the highest gods of the Fimir. They claimed as their territory a large chunk of the land now known as the Wasteland. They came into conflict with the verminous Skaven, who wanted the territory to establish there a base of operation similar to their capital of Skavenblight. The Skaven slowly pushed the Killing-Eye Clan back, deeper and deeper into their bogs, until in a last act of desperation, the clan's last living Meargh enacted a great magic ritual, sacrificing her life force so that the very swamp would come alive and drown the entire Skaven army. While victorious in the end, the Killing-Eyes were left without any Meargh to rule over them, and as such, took upon themselves the death-quest, to clear their shame in death. To this day, they still roam the Old World, their vast numbers allowing them to survive for this long. They hate Skaven virulently, and will usually venture deep into the warrens of the ratmen and clear them to the last in a murderous frenzy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_marsh_hounds	Appearing as a horrible mockery of a hound made out of claws, teeth, and bog plantlife, Marsh Hounds, also known as "Shocks" or "Black Shucks", are terrible daemons of uncertain origins. Intrinsically bound to the Fimir, they are said to be the hounds of Balor of the Killing-Eye, one of the main Fimir gods. The Dirach are able to summon large packs of these creatures, which will be used in battle to harass and flank the lighter enemy troops with deadly speed. Their claws and teeth are poisonous, containing the noxious toxins of the deadly swamp plants that make up their bodies.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_fimm_warriors_axe_throwers_ror	This particular band of Fimm Warriors has pledged their absolute loyalty to the Daemon Prince Balor. In their eyes, he is the greatest of the Fimir's deities who will lead their people into a new golden age. They fight with an axe in each hand to imitate the fighting style of their god.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_gharnus_demon	Gharnu and his band of "Daemon-Friends" are an extremely infamous raiding party composed exclusively of members of the Fianna rank of the Fimm Caste. Notorious for their exploits in the northern, cold regions of Albion, they are known for their disciplined brutality in battle. Gharnu himself is a cruel and particularly clever Fimm, it is said that he was born with a Fimm's brawn but the devious and calculating brain of a Dirach, and he leads his Fianna with extreme discipline. Once, he lured a much larger warband of Albionese warriors who were defending one of their villages into a frozen lake located in the frozen northern parts of Albion. When the Albionese arrived at the centre of the lake, he ordered his Fianna to stomp on the ice from the lake's shore. breaking it and submerging the surprised warriors of Albion in its frozen depths, leaving the Daemon-Friends to freely pillage and plunder the village they were defending. While most other Fianna prefer to fight with wild abandon using two weapons or a single gigantic one, Gharnu's Fianna fight with mace and shield in ordered ranks, pushing the enemy back with their considerable mass, advancing as a monstruous armed phalanx.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_fianna_fimm	The Fianna Fimm are the elite of the Fimm caste. They are above the common FImm Warriors and under the Fimm Nobles. In the absence of a Dirach or a Nobleman, they will command smaller raiding parties composed of lesser Fimm and Shearl. They are able to afford the finest weapons and armour, usually charging into battle as heavily armoured bands of shock troops, usually armed with finely crafted maces, the weapon favoured by Fimm of higher status. They are usually part of the personal bodyguard of the Fimm Nobles of the Clan, protecting them at all times and serving as the closest members of their retinue.  The Fianna Fimm usually grow to a larger size than the rest of the rest of the Fimm caste, closer to the Nobles in stature, and as such, are a devastating force on the battlefield.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_fimm_guard	The Fianna Fimm are the elite of the Fimm caste. They are above the common FImm Warriors and under the Fimm Nobles. In the absence of a Dirach or a Nobleman, they will command smaller raiding parties composed of lesser Fimm and Shearl. They are able to afford the finest weapons and armour, usually charging into battle as heavily armoured bands of shock troops, usually armed with finely crafted maces, the weapon favoured by Fimm of higher status. They are usually part of the personal bodyguard of the Fimm Nobles of the Clan, protecting them at all times and serving as the closest members of their retinue.  The Fianna Fimm usually grow to a larger size than the rest of the rest of the Fimm caste, closer to the Nobles in stature, and as such, are a devastating force on the battlefield.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_mistmor	The Mistmor are misshapen members of the Fimm caste, monstrous in size with spikes painfully protruding from their bones, mouths so full of teeth they can't completely close them, and extremely dull in intelligence. It is unknown what causes a Fimm to be born Mistmor, but it is said that it's the result of an excess of Daemonic blood on a newborn Fimm, which in most Fimir, courses in equal quantities with Human blood. Even if they are generally stupid and slow, Mistmors are valued in Fimir society for their great strength and subservient attitude (especially towards the Meargh), which allows them to be easily directed in all sorts of tasks, such as assisting the Shearl in the construction of larger structures in the stronghold or in battle, as monstruously powerful shock troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_mon_javelin_0	The lowly Shearl represents what is considered the lowest caste of Fimir society, being also the most numerous of them. Weaker and smaller than the other Fimir, the Shearl are tasked mainly with maintaining their settlements. They gather, preserve, and cook the food; they fashion weapons and armour for the Fimm caste. Regardless of how crude they appear, all of their creations are functional, as anyone who has attempted to attack a Fimir stronghold can attest. They are considered thralls by the other Fimir castes and are expected to obey their every command. Most Fimir have difficulty with ranged combat, due to their single eye offering limited depth perception, but some Shearls are experts at throwing sharpened wood javelins during their hunting sessions in the bogs. During battle, they serve as one of the few ranged troops FImir raiding parties can count on.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_mon_caster_0	Though all members of the Dirach caste have an innate talent for magic, not all are equally skilled in their skill at weaving the Winds. Some devote their skills to more mundane administrative efforts, such as directing the efforts of the Shearl or leading the Stronghold's religious rituals. When a Fimir clan goes to war, these lesser Dirach, known variously as "apprentices" or "magelings" will do their part on the battlefield, using their natural skill at magic to cast powerful bolts of pure magical energy to act as ranged magical support for the raiding parties of their clan.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_cav_bog_beast_riders	Known variously as Bog Beast Raiders, Marsh Reavers, or Lizard Wranglers, these brave Fimm ride a type of lizard found nearby swamps inhabited by the Fimir. Many claim these to be a kind of daemonic creature that's tied to marshes, but that claim is unsubstantiated. These lizards, known as bog beasts or marsh monitors, are very real, very temperamental, and very dangerous creatures. Fimm who wish to ride one of them, must first wrangle with the creature and break it. When the deed is done, the Fimm returns to his clan victorious, now one of the famed Bog Beast Raiders. In battle, they act fast shock troops, armed with gigantic glaives they easily wield one handed, while their lizard mounts spit venom and throw poisonous quills at the enemy.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_finmor	The Finmor, or Fimm Finmor, are a specific rank within the Fimm caste, composed of those Fimm born from a Noble father. These Fimir are eager to prove themselves in battle, hoping to catch the eye of their betters to ascend into the Noble rank some day. During peacetime, they will engage in strength contests, such as boulder throwing or log lifting, and even ritualised duels to prove their worth as true Fimm Nobles. They are often left in charge of defending and guarding the Meargh while the rest of the Fimm are away. Many Finmor, young and impetuous as they are, consider this task boring and dull, but it is those who are stalwart in their duty to the Mearghs who are given their blessing to ascend to Noble rank, for nothing is more important in Fimir society than the Witch-Queens. The Finmor will go to battle in some of the best armour their Stronghold can provide, finely crafted and decorated by FImir standards, bringing their considerable might to bear against the foes of their clan.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_cha_fimirach_noble_0	The Fimm Nobles, or Fimirach, are the undisputed rulers of the Fimm caste, and the most respected figures in FImir Strongholds. They represent the military might of the FImir, while the Dirach represent arcane wisdom, and the Meargh rule as high priestess. They are the most physically powerful of the Fimm caste, likely of the whole Fimir race, standing several metres above their lesser kin. The Nobles and the Dirach often bicker over who gets to wield more power, and one Fimirach murdering a Dirach, or the other way around, over such matters is not completely unknown, though usually before tension reaches that point, the ruling Meargh will intervene and give a stern talk and likely a punishment to either party, for the good of the Stronghold. For all their boasting, though, the Nobles are obligated to follow the wisdom of the Dirach or the Meargh, for, while competent in matters of war, they're not exceptionally clever, and, like all Fimir, they detest sunlight, so they need the approval of the Dirach to that these might aid the Nobles and their Fimm warriors against it, covering them in the infamous magical mist that the Daemonfriends are able to generate with their powers. During peacetime, they are in charge of training, drilling, and preparing all Fimm warriors, young and adult, for war, and they are also in charge of planning and organising the raiding parties the Fimir are so infamous for. On the battlefield, they're savage warriors and imposing figures, wearing the best and most decorated armour, and gigantic two handed maces which they wield with brutal strength.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_skattach_long_text	Mother Skattach, ambitious even for one of the Meargh, has become an infamous figure amongst the Fimir. She was once the ruler of a backwater Stronghold called Rancor Hold, but now she's feared even by the rest of the Meargh. Her rise to power started when a Meargh was born in her clan, normally a cause for celebration. One of her subordinate Dirach, known as Gobniu, attempted to murder Skattach and replace her with the newborn Meargh, to rule from the shadows. Skattach managed to thwart Gobniu's plan and kill him in return, as is Fimir custom. But when she got her claws on the young Meargh, she murdered the newborn on the spot, fearing that it would lead to other ambitious Dirach like Gobniu having fantasies of rebellion. The word got out and the Meargh from other Strongholds started calling her "Hellmother, mockingly, after a dreaded and hated mythological figure who once united all Fimir clans by murdering their Mearghs and claiming the Strongholds under them as her own. This has not hindered Skattach at all. Quite the contrary, she now revels in this, and demands everyone address her as Hellmother Skattach. She has gone as far as to have her most powerful Dirach and skilled Shearls fashion her a terrible enchanted crown like that of the Hellmother of legend. Now she plans to fulfil her destiny as Hellmother, unifying all Fimir by all means necessary, bringing them to victory over the Human usurpers and ruling over the swamps, bogs, and marshes of the whole world, hoping to eventually find the Wandering Island, the mythical homeland of the Fimir race, and rule from the Obsidian Castle within as the Mother of All Fimir, forever.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_fimir_dirach	The Dirach are the second-most important caste in FImir society, with only the Mearghs above them. They have a natural, innate talent for wielding the Winds of Magic, and also bind daemonic entities to their will, for which they are known as "Daemonfriends." At once clever and wise, but cruel as all Fimir are, during peacetime, the Dirach direct the administrative efforts of the Fimir Strongholds, making sure that food and other necessary resources are distributed evenly, and that the Shearl tralls are properly kept in line and focused on their various tasks. While all Dirach can wield the Winds, only the Balefiends and Elders have been trained as disciples by the Meargh to fully develop their abilities as sorcerers. The Dirach Elders are the highest rank in their caste, often forming part of the inner circle that advises a particular Stronghold's Meargh, alongside the strongest of the Fimm Nobles. The Elders and the Nobles will often bicker with and try to ridicule each other before the eye of the ruling Meargh, hoping to earn her favour. The truth is that no one of them is more important than the other for the continuing stability of the Stronghold, but the Meargh encourage a limited amount of competition and bickering, for it keeps the Dirach and Fimm leaders' respective skills sharpened for when the time comes for conflict against outsiders. In battle, they wield the Winds to provide magic support for the Fimir raiding parties to terrifying effect, using their magic to burn, wither, and murder enemy troops from afar.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_nuckelavee	Nuckelavees, known variously as horse-devils of the swamps or flayed riders, are a kind of daemon summoned by Fimir Dirach. These daemons are created by fusing the soul of a dead human or any other intelligent creature with the vengeful, damonically-corrupted nature of the bogs inhabited by the Fimir. The result is a horrible creature, an incarnation of decay and revenge, resembling the upper body of a horned humanoid creature mishapenly fused with a horse-like daemon with webbed feet, with all of its skin flayed, hanging in shreds all over the Nuckelavee's terrible form. They particularly loathe those among the mortal races who despoil and encroach on the swamp to grow their crop fields, and will often cause fields of grain to decay with their noxious breath, and behead the farmers with their daemonic sword-like arms. The Dirach will often bind a sizeable number of these horrible daemons for use in battle as cavalry support for Fimir forces, using them to cut a swath through enemy flanks with their magical blades.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_daemonomaniac	Daemonomaniacs are the pinnacle of Dirach Daemonology; Fimm caste warriors are infused with one or more daemonic spirits, causing them to grow to colossal sizes of 10 feet or more. The transformation is a horrible thing to behold, even for the callous Fimir. Bones break and elongate, with the ends of one or more limbs transforming into sharpened daemonic blades. Not all Fimm survive this ordeal, and many are indeed destroyed by the raw energy required for the Daemonomaniac Ritual. Even amongst those who survive, few live long enough, for sometimes the mutations are too gruesome or leave the Fimm crippled, forcing the Dirach to destroy these failures. Those who survive and become demonomaniacs receive incredible strength and stature, far beyond any common FImm, completely infused with daemonic energies, to the point where they become one with the daemonic spirits they host, banished along with them back to the Realms of Chaos if defeated in battle. They usually gain different abilities depending on the daemon inhabiting them, though the most commonly compatible with the mindset of a member of the Fimm caste is that of Khorne's servants, and so, most daemonomaniacs become savage warriors with the ability to breathe fire, becoming a terrible sight on the battlefield.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_swamp_daemons	Known variously as Mud-men, Bog Things, or Servants of Fimul, Swamp Daemons are daemonic entities closely aligned with the Fimir. These creatures are strange frog-like humanoids, with bodies that are often smooth in places but scaled in others, and usually have the heads of a mishappen mix of fish and dragons, with wide mouths sharpened teeth, and poisonous claws. They are usually summoned and bound by the Dirach to guard the borders of the Fimir swamps, where they are adept at ambushing the unwary with a glowing orb that hangs from an antenna on their head. Their origin is uncertain, but they seem to be related to Fimul, the daemonic Mud-God and legendary progenitor of the Fimir race. In battle, they will act as vanguard ambushers who will attempt to silently close the distance with the enemy, later ripping them to shreds with their toxic talons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_eye_oculus	The Fog-Shrine of Balor, also known as Tower of Ruin or Eye Oculus, is a special kind of summoning altar used by a Dirach Daemonologist to summon and bind one of the most powerful manifestations of Balor of the Killing-Eye, one of the most prominent Daemon-Gods of the FImir. The Eye of Balor, as this creature is usually known, takes various shapes, but the most consistent feature is a gigantic eye. When roused by the Dirach Daemonologist who bound the daemon to the Altar, the creature will emit a powerful ray of energy from its eye, disintegrating any foe foolish enough to stand against it. It's usually dragged to battle by Bog Beasts, and a single Dirach Daemonologist will crew it. The Fog-Shrine also inspires nearby Fimir warriors to terrible and savage deeds in battle, for it is a shard of the very essence of their mighty warrior-god Balor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_daemonomaniac_ror	The "Eye of Doom" is the single most successful Daemonomaniac produced by the Dirach caste. Normally, Khornate daemon-spirits are chosen to be infused and subsumed with the soul of the Fimm host during the Daemonomaniac ritual because their similar warlike mindsets facilitate the merging. Not so with the mysterious Fimir now known as the Eye of Doom Daemonomaniac. He was a particularly vain Fimm Noble, who, unusually for the dour Fimm took extreme pride in his kills and martial proficiency, known to march to the battlefield in golden armour incrusted with precious stones (both of which the Fimir usually consider worthless ), the Dirach managed to convince him to undergo the Daemonomaniac Ritual, telling him that it would exponentially increase his skills in battle. This Noble was the ideal candidate to host a powerful daemonic entity, a greater servant of Slaanesh, Prince of Pleasure. The Noble's mind and soul were perfectly aligned with that of the daemonic spirit, and the merging of both was a great success. Rising from the ritual circle as a terrible, gargantuan four-armed creature with Fimir and Slaaneshi features, the beast is now known only as the "Eye of Doom", slashing and carving his way amongst enemy forces with great delight, using his four ams ending in jagged daemonic blades to inflict great pain upon the enemies of his Dirach masters.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_marsh_hornets_ror	The Swamp Scorpions, led by the Fianna Fimm known as Skean, are an elite band of Bog Beast Raiders known for their lethality and endurance on the battlefield. While most Bog Beast Raiders prefer to ride their beasts in light armour and armed only with a glaive, the Swamp Scorpions, proud Fianna as they are, ride their beasts heavily armoured in the finest plate they can afford, wielding shields and lethal maces. They also fight differently from other Bog Beast Raiders, preferring to charge against the enemy frontlines and stay engaged as long as possible, which they are usually able to accomplish thanks to their heavier armour and greater natural strength. 	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_moor_hounds_ror	The creatures known as the Hounds of Basket Moor are of similar daemonic origins to the Nuckelavees, vengeful daemons with close ties to the swamp, only these take the form of horrible flayed horned hounds. Unlike the Horse-Daemons of the Swamp though, the Hounds of Basket Moor were never summoned on purpose by a Dirach, only bound by them. Somewhere in the Wastelands, there's a place known as the Moor of Basket, and deep within this moor lies a decrepit palace. The swamp has infiltrated what was once a beautiful building, now abandoned and dilapidated. The legend says that a cruel nobleman lived here once, who hunted women for sport, setting his captives free only to release his hounds on them, letting the animals pursue and crripple the victim only for the nobleman to deliver a sadistic killing blow. One day, he captured a priestess of Rhya, Goddess of Nature and proceeded to indulge in his twisted hunting game with her. The priestess ended up sharing the fate of the depraved nobleman's other victims, but not before uttering a death curse on him, that nature would take him and everything he owns. Later, when the night fell, the nobleman's own hunting hounds broke from their pens and gave chase to their master, who tried to flee in vain to the same moors where he hunted his victims, only to get bogged down by the marshy terrain surrounding his lands and devoured by his own hounds. The rest of his estate was engulfed by the swamp the next day. It is said that the Hounds of Basket Moor were born out of the power of the curse and the nobleman's own hunting hounds, now warped and mutated into horrific daemons, forever to hunt those who would dare to step inside Basket Moor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_fenbeast	Fenbeasts are humanoid-shaped hulks made out of the spirits and bones of creatures drowned in the fens and swamps, as well as the mud, damp timber, and rotting flora that make up the bogs. The amorphous mass is held together by a tiny Ogham Stone implanted in the core of their bodies. Fenbeasts are utterly mindless, have no fear or pain, and are incredibly powerful. They will revert to mud and decaying marsh detritus if their summoner is slain. Both the Truthsayers and Druids of Albion and the Dark Emissarios of the Great Master of the Citadel of Lead make use of these creatures, and have been known to "sell" them as mercenaries to armies outside of Albion, where they are appreciated as effective, if slightly unsettling, shock troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_balefiend	A millennia ago, amphibious humanoids known as the Fimir were favoured by the Chaos Gods. Then, as the Gods turned their attentions to the more vibrant and amusing race of man, the Fimir were abandoned. Having since existed in reclusion, they are still doing the bidding of the Ruinous Powers as way of regaining their favour. Their mysterious Balefiends wield a powerful magic that appears crude and ritualistic to outsiders, but is incredibly potent. They spend prolonged periods away from the swamps, harvesting power from daemons to destabilise the barrier between the mortal world and the Realm of Chaos.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_warriors	With a single eye atop a fanged snout, and deathly yellow-grey flesh that can shrug off blows that would kill a mortal man outright, the amphibious humanoid monsters known as the Fimir are horrific living legends. Their origins are unknown to most, but a millennium ago they were roaring the praises of the Dark Gods as they despoiled the lands of men living in the area that would later become the Empire. Then, one day, the Gods abandoned them in favour of man.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_bog_octopus_0	Most Octopi are relatively harmless (if not enchanting) aquatic creatures which live, for the most part, in tropical oceans. The Bog Octopus, however, is not of this ilk. It has the look of a huge Octopus, with eight tentacles, huge round eyes, and green skin - but there the resemblance ends. These creatures live in the cold and forbidding marshes and bogs of the Old World. Their entire lives are spent squelching menacingly around in stinking mud and quagmires, surfacing occasionally to drag down and eat some passing creature. Living in such a dense medium, they are incredibly strong and, once caught by a tentacle, it is very hard for all but the strongest creatures to escape.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_cha_daemon_octopus_kroll	Kroll, Ancient Evil, All-Mother, and Matriarch of the Bog Octopuses, is one of the demi-gods of the Fimir, all of them Daemon Princes aligned to none of the Four Powers. Formerly subservient to the dead Fimir god, Fimul the Mud Lord, they now follow their own inscrutable paths. Kroll is a terrible beast that has plagued the world's bogs and marshes since well before the arrival of the Old Ones, and she arrogantly claims all swamps as her domain. Much larger than her children, red in color, and with a terrible beak, Kroll has accrued many trinkets, weapons, and magical objects from those who tried and failed to slay her. To think she's a mindless monster would be falling into a terrible trap, for she's a being of great intelligence and cunning. Kroll is worshipped at all levels of Fimir society. The Shearl admire her nest building abilities. The Fimm are impressed by her raw strength, deadly flailing arms, and armour-piercing beak - the tradition of carrying two weapons by the Fimm Nobles stems from Kroll. The Meargh and Dirach are equally impressed by the quiet intelligence and cunning of Kroll. Kroll is as comfortable in salt water as she is in fresh water, and she is respected by coastal and inland Fimir alike.	true
