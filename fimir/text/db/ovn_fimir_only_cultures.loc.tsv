cultures_frontend_description_ovn_fimir	Born from the unholy union of the human witch Maris and the Daemon Fimúl, the Mud God, the Fimir are cyclopean, amphibious humanoid creatures that dwell within the marshes, bogs, and dreary meadows scattered across the world. Their fortresses rise from the mire as ominous, jagged mounds of rock, crudely fashioned in the semblance of the castles of more civilised races. Such dwellings are seldom seen by outsiders, for they are wreathed in thick mist – a miasma conjured through dark sorcery to shield their fortresses from inquisitive eyes, and to spare themselves from the harsh glare of the sun.\\n\\nOnce the favoured servants of the Ruinous Powers, the Fimir were abandoned when their capricious masters turned their gaze upon Mankind. In their exile, they turned to Balor – a mighty Fimm Noble elevated by Fimúl to Daemon Princehood – who now serves as their patron in their wounded creator’s absence. Divided into four castes – the lowly Shearl, the warlike Fimm, the sorcerous Dirach, and the Meargh, leaders and only females of their race – the Fimir endure as a secretive and malign people, bound by mist and memory, ever striving to reclaim their ancient glory and once more stand as the chosen race of the Dark Gods.	false
