unit_description_historical_texts_text_elo_boglar_shaman	In Boglar society - such as it is - the highest authority is the Shaman. Much like other Greenskin breeds, the Boglars are deeply superstitious, covering themselves in crude fetishes, trinkets, and charms they believe grant them luck or power in the treacherous bogs they inhabit.\\n\\nAs such, they hold magic in great reverence. Boglar Shamans serve as intermediaries with their tribe’s Fimir overlords, who demand tribute - however meagre - not for need, but to remind the Boglars of their subjugation. They also requisition Boglar slaves to serve in their raiding parties.\\n\\nBoglar Shamans draw power from both the sodden lands they dwell in and the crude, collective energy of their tribes. Their spells often manifest as water-borne curses or twisted echoes of the Greenskin magicks known to their Goblin kin. Despite their masters’ cruelty, the Boglars worship the Fimir as much out of fear as awe. Some Fimir chieftains have even been known to bind Marsh Hound daemons as mounts or familiars for their most “favoured” Boglar lackeys - if the wretches survive the first meeting. Boglar Shamans adorn themselves with swamp fungi and strange growths, believing these charms help them carry “Da Power o’ da Bog” wherever they go.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_boglar	Boglars - known variously as Marsh-Gnoblars or Swamp Goblins - are a degenerate strain of Gnoblar that dwell in the foulest bogs and swamps. As cruel and capricious as their kin, their chief pastime is the slow dissection and devouring of any hapless creature they catch. With beady eyes, fin-like ears, blue-grey skin, and needle-sharp teeth, they present a more sinister visage than common Gnoblars.\\n\\nMany Boglar tribes, especially those dwelling near the Marshes of Madness, live in uneasy alliance - forced or otherwise - with the cyclopean Fimir. Both races despise sunlight, and the Fimir permit the Boglars to dwell beneath the unnatural mists that cloak their domains. In exchange, the Boglars serve as expendable fodder when the Fimir march to war, thrown forward to distract and bog down the foe while their masters strike from the shadows.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_shearl	The lowly Shearl form the bottom of Fimir society’s rigid caste system, though they are also its most numerous. Smaller and weaker than other Fimir, the Shearls are tasked with maintaining the stronghold - gathering, preserving, and cooking food, as well as crafting weapons and armour for the Fimm warriors. Crude though their work appears, it is effective, as any who have dared assault a Fimir fortress can attest.\\n\\nRegarded as thralls by their betters, Shearls are expected to obey without question. In times of war, the Mearghs or Fimm Nobles conscript them en masse, arming them poorly and sending them to die as fodder - or to haul home the spoils of conquest. Yet when roused to battle, even the humblest Shearl can display the same savage fury as any of their kin.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_death_quest	When the Meargh of a Fimir stronghold dies without a successor, her clan dissolves into what is known as a Death-Quest - a doomed host formed from all castes without distinction, with Shearls, Fimm, and Dirach marching side by side.\\n\\nMuch like the Dwarfen Slayers, the purpose of this grim pilgrimage is to meet death in battle, redeeming their failure to protect their Meargh and ensure the clan’s survival by finding another. While the Shearls usually perish first, the Fimm and Dirach of a Death-Quest often live long enough to become wandering mercenaries, lending their strength to destructive hosts such as Greenskins, Skaven, or the Forces of Chaos - for no others will suffer the malign Fimir among their ranks.\\n\\nUsually led by either a Dirach or a Fimm Noble, these doomed bands often quarrel bitterly over who will lead them to their final end.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_killing_eye	Once one of the largest and most dreaded Fimir clans, the nobles and Mearghs of the Killing-Eye claimed direct descent from Balor and Fimúl, the highest gods of their race. Their domain once encompassed a great swathe of the land now known as the Wasteland.\\n\\nThey came into conflict with the verminous Skaven, who sought the territory as a new bastion akin to Skavenblight. Slowly, the ratmen drove the Killing-Eye clan back into their fetid bogs, until at last, in desperation, the final living Meargh performed a great ritual - sacrificing her own life to awaken the swamp itself. The mire rose and drowned the Skaven army, wiping it from existence.\\n\\nThough victorious, the clan was left without a ruler. In their shame, they swore the Death-Quest, seeking redemption only in battle and annihilation. To this day, the remnants of the Killing-Eye roam the Old World, their numbers diminished yet unbroken. They harbour a burning hatred for the Skaven, delving into their warrens to slaughter every rat that draws breath.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_marsh_hounds	Appearing as a grotesque mockery of hounds wrought from claws, teeth, and swamp-grown sinew, Marsh Hounds - also known as “Shocks” or “Black Shucks” - are dreadful daemons of uncertain origin.\\n\\nIntrinsically bound to the Fimir, they are said to be the hunting beasts of Balor of the Killing-Eye, one of the great Fimir gods. The Dirach summon packs of these creatures to harry and flank lighter enemy troops with terrifying speed. Their claws and fangs drip with venomous ichor, their bodies infused with the noxious essence of the swamps that spawned them.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_fimm_warriors_axe_throwers_ror	This particular band of Fimm Warriors has pledged absolute loyalty to the Daemon Prince Balor. In their eyes, he is the greatest of the Fimir’s gods, destined to lead their kind into a new golden age.\\n\\nThey fight with an axe in each hand, mimicking the dual-wielding fury of their god, and march into battle chanting his dreadful name, believing each slain foe brings them closer to his favour.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_gharnus_demon	Gharnu and his band of “Daemon-Friends” are a notorious raiding party composed exclusively of warriors of the Fianna rank. Feared throughout the frozen north of Albion, they are known for their disciplined brutality in battle.\\n\\nGharnu himself is a cruel and cunning Fimm - born, it is said, with the strength of a warrior and the mind of a Dirach. He leads his Fianna with iron discipline. In one infamous raid, he lured a larger warband of Albionese defenders onto a frozen lake, then ordered his warriors to shatter the ice beneath them, drowning the foe in icy death before plundering their village.\\n\\nWhile most Fianna favour wild abandon, dual blades, or massive weapons, Gharnu’s Daemon-Friends fight with mace and shield in tight formation - advancing as a monstrous, disciplined phalanx that crushes all in its path.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_fianna_fimm	The Fianna Fimm are the elite of the Fimm caste - above the common warriors yet below the nobles. In the absence of a Dirach or Noble, they command smaller raiding parties of lesser Fimm and Shearls.\\n\\nThey can afford the finest weapons and armour, fighting as heavily armoured shock troops armed with intricately crafted maces - the weapon most favoured by Fimm of high status. Many serve as personal bodyguards to the clan’s Fimm Nobles, protecting them in battle and attending them in all things.\\n\\nThe Fianna often grow larger and stronger than their kin, approaching the stature of the Nobles themselves. When unleashed in battle, they strike with devastating might, their war-cries echoing across the mire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_fimm_guard	The Fianna Fimm are the elite of the Fimm caste - above the common warriors yet below the nobles. In the absence of a Dirach or Noble, they command smaller raiding parties of lesser Fimm and Shearls.\\n\\nThey can afford the finest weapons and armour, fighting as heavily armoured shock troops armed with intricately crafted maces - the weapon most favoured by Fimm of high status. Many serve as personal bodyguards to the clan’s Fimm Nobles, protecting them in battle and attending them in all things.\\n\\nThe Fianna often grow larger and stronger than their kin, approaching the stature of the Nobles themselves. When unleashed in battle, they strike with devastating might, their war-cries echoing across the mire.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_mistmor	The Mistmor are misshapen members of the Fimm caste - monstrous in size, with spikes painfully protruding from their bones and mouths so crammed with teeth they can barely close them. Their minds are slow and dull, yet their strength is immense.\\n\\nIt is unknown what causes a Fimm to be born a Mistmor, though it is said to result from an excess of daemonic blood in a newborn - blood that, in most Fimir, runs in equal measure with that of mankind. Despite their dim wits, Mistmor are valued for their brute strength and unquestioning obedience, especially toward the Meargh. They serve as labourers in the construction of great strongholds or as terrifying shock troops in battle, where their raw power is unleashed to devastating effect.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_mon_javelin_0	The lowly Shearl form the bottom of Fimir society’s rigid caste system, though they are also its most numerous. Smaller and weaker than other Fimir, the Shearls are tasked with maintaining the stronghold - gathering, preserving, and cooking food, as well as crafting weapons and armour for the Fimm warriors. Crude though their work appears, it is effective, as any who have dared assault a Fimir fortress can attest.\\n\\nRegarded as thralls by their betters, Shearls are expected to obey without question. In times of war, the Mearghs or Fimm Nobles conscript them en masse, arming them poorly and sending them to die as fodder - or to haul home the spoils of conquest. Yet when roused to battle, even the humblest Shearl can display the same savage fury as any of their kin.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_mon_caster_0	Though all members of the Dirach caste possess innate magical talent, not all are equally adept at weaving the Winds. Some devote their gifts to more mundane tasks - overseeing the Shearls’ labour or presiding over the stronghold’s rituals.\\n\\nWhen a Fimir clan marches to war, these lesser Dirach, known as “apprentices” or “magelings,” lend their powers to the fray. Using their natural sorcery, they hurl bolts of raw magical energy to smite the foe from afar, serving as deadly ranged support for their clan’s raiding parties.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_cav_bog_beast_riders	Known variously as Bog Beast Raiders, Marsh Reavers, or Lizard Wranglers, these fearless Fimm ride a species of massive swamp lizard found near Fimir settlements. Some claim these beasts are daemonic in origin, bound to the mists and marshes themselves, though such tales remain unproven.\\n\\nThese creatures - called bog beasts or marsh monitors - are dangerously temperamental and lethally strong. To claim one as a mount, a Fimm must wrestle and break it through sheer will and might. Victorious, he returns to his clan as one of the honoured Bog Beast Raiders. In battle, they strike as swift shock troops, wielding huge glaives one-handed while their reptilian mounts spit venom and hurl barbed quills at the foe.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_finmor	The Finmor, or Fimm Finmor, are a distinct rank within the Fimm caste, composed of those born from Noble fathers. These Fimir are eager to prove themselves in battle, hoping to catch the eye of their betters and ascend to the noble rank one day. During peacetime, they engage in feats of strength such as boulder-throwing, log-lifting, or ritual duels to demonstrate their worth as future Fimm Nobles.\\n\\nThey are often left to guard and protect the Meargh while the rest of the Fimm march abroad. Many Finmor - young and impetuous as they are - consider this task dull, yet it is those who serve faithfully that earn the Meargh’s blessing to ascend in rank. Nothing is more sacred in Fimir society than the Witch-Queens.\\n\\nIn battle, the Finmor don the finest armour their stronghold can forge, bearing weapons of great craftsmanship - formidable warriors who bring their considerable might to bear in defence of their clan.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_cha_fimirach_noble_0	The Fimm Nobles are the undisputed rulers of the Fimm caste and the most respected figures within a Fimir stronghold. They embody the military might of their race, while the Dirach represent arcane wisdom, and the Meargh reigns as high priestess. Standing several metres tall, they are the most physically powerful of all Fimir.\\n\\nThe Nobles and the Dirach frequently quarrel over influence, and bloodshed between them is not unheard of. Yet before such conflicts boil over, the ruling Meargh will usually intervene, imposing her will to preserve order. For all their bluster, the Nobles remain bound by the counsel of the Dirach and the authority of the Meargh. While unmatched in warcraft, they are not especially cunning, and - like all Fimir - they despise sunlight, relying on the Dirach to shroud them in the protective mists of the swamps.\\n\\nIn times of peace, they oversee the training and drilling of the Fimm, organise raids, and prepare the stronghold for war. On the battlefield, they are savage and imposing, clad in ornate armour and wielding colossal two-handed maces with terrifying strength.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_skattach_long_text	Mother Skattach, ambitious even for one of the Meargh, has become an infamous figure amongst the Fimir. Once the ruler of a backwater stronghold known as Rancor Hold, she is now feared even by her own kind. Her rise began when a newborn Meargh was born into her clan – a rare cause for celebration. One of her Dirach, Derghe, sought to overthrow her by murdering Skattach and raising the newborn as a puppet ruler, but the plot failed and Derghe perished by her claws. In a fit of ruthless pragmatism, Skattach slew the infant Meargh herself, ensuring no other ambitious Dirach would attempt the same. Word of her deed spread, and the Meargh of other strongholds mockingly named her “Hell-Mother”, after the dread figure of legend who once united the clans through murder and conquest. Skattach embraced the name, donning a crown forged in her image and swearing to fulfil that dark legacy – to unite the Fimir by all means necessary, reclaim their lost glory, and rule from the mythical Obsidian Castle as the Mother of All Fimir.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_fimir_dirach	The Dirach are the second-most important caste in Fimir society, standing just below the Mearghs. Gifted with an innate mastery of the Winds of Magic, they are also skilled in binding daemonic entities to their will - hence their title, “Daemon-Friends.” Clever and wise, yet as cruel as any of their kin, the Dirach oversee the administrative affairs of the strongholds in times of peace, ensuring that food and resources are properly distributed and that the Shearl thralls remain obedient and industrious.\\n\\nWhile all Dirach can wield the Winds, only the Balefiends and Elders receive formal tutelage from the Meargh, developing their sorcery to its fullest. The Elders form the upper echelons of their caste, often serving in the Meargh’s inner council alongside the mightiest of the Fimm Nobles. Rivalry between the two groups is constant; both seek to earn the Meargh’s favour, mocking and undermining one another in her presence. Yet this competition, carefully tolerated by the Meargh, keeps both cunning and strength sharpened for war.\\n\\nIn battle, the Dirach unleash their powers to devastating effect - searing, withering, and annihilating foes from afar while cloaking their kin in mist and shadow.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_nuckelavee	Nuckelavees, known to mortals as the horse-devils of the swamps or the flayed riders, are daemons summoned and bound by the Dirach. These horrors are formed through a blasphemous fusion of a dead mortal’s soul with the vengeful, daemonic essence of the bogs themselves. The result is a monstrous parody of life - a horned, half-human upper body grotesquely fused with a horse-like daemon, its skin flayed and hanging in tatters.\\n\\nNuckelavees embody decay and spite. They despise those who despoil the swamps for farmland, spreading rot across fields with their noxious breath and decapitating intruders with blade-like limbs. The Dirach bind these abominations in droves, unleashing them in battle as nightmarish cavalry that slice through enemy ranks with daemonic precision.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_daemonomaniac	Daemonomaniacs are the pinnacle of Dirach daemonology - Fimm warriors infused with one or more daemonic spirits, transforming them into towering monstrosities over ten feet tall. The ritual of their creation is a nightmare even to behold. Bones splinter and stretch; limbs warp into jagged, blade-like appendages. Few survive the process, for the surge of raw energy often tears body and soul apart.\\n\\nThose who endure emerge as living engines of destruction, their strength and size multiplied beyond mortal measure. Their bodies teem with daemonic energy until host and spirit become one, banished together back to the Realm of Chaos upon death. The powers they manifest depend on the nature of the daemon bound within - though most favour the rage-filled spirits of Khorne. Such Daemonomaniacs become fire-breathing avatars of slaughter, their presence on the battlefield both terrifying and awe-inspiring.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_swamp_daemons	Known variously as Mud-Men, Bog Things, or Servants of Fimúl, Swamp Daemons are entities closely aligned with the Fimir. These strange, frog-like humanoids have bodies that are smooth in some places but scaled in others, and their heads resemble a grotesque blend of fish and dragon - wide-mouthed, fanged, and equipped with poisonous claws.\\n\\nThey are usually summoned and bound by the Dirach to guard the borders of the Fimir swamps, where they lie in wait for the unwary. Each bears a glowing lure upon an antenna atop its head, which it uses to draw prey close before striking. Their true origin is uncertain, but they are believed to be kin to Fimúl, the Daemonic Mud-God and legendary progenitor of the Fimir race. In battle, they serve as vanguard ambushers, closing silently with the enemy before rending them to pieces with their toxic talons.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_eye_oculus	The Fog-Shrine of Balor - also known as the Tower of Ruin or Eye Oculus - is a terrible summoning altar used by Dirach Daemonologists to call forth and bind one of the mightiest manifestations of Balor of the Killing-Eye, a great Daemon-God of the Fimir.\\n\\nThe Eye of Balor, as this entity is known, manifests in various forms, though always marked by a single, immense, all-seeing eye. When roused by its master, it unleashes a blinding ray of annihilation, disintegrating any foe foolish enough to stand before it. The shrine is dragged into battle by Bog Beasts, crewed by a single Dirach who maintains its dark focus.\\n\\nThe Fog-Shrine radiates a dreadful aura, inspiring nearby Fimir to acts of savage ferocity - for within it burns a fragment of the essence of Balor himself.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_daemonomaniac_ror	The “Eye of Doom” is the most infamous Daemonomaniac ever created by the Dirach caste. Normally, Khornate daemon-spirits are chosen for such fusions, as their violent nature aligns easily with the Fimm’s martial mind. But not so with the one who would become the Eye of Doom.\\n\\nOnce, he was a proud and vain Fimm Noble - unusual among his dour kin - who took great pride in his victories and wore golden armour studded with jewels, both trappings the Fimir normally disdain. Enticed by a Dirach’s promise of ultimate power, he underwent the Daemonomaniac ritual, becoming host to a greater servant of Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure.\\n\\nThe merging was a success. Rising from the ritual circle as a monstrous, four-armed fusion of Fimir and Slaaneshi daemon, the creature became known as the Eye of Doom. On the battlefield he is a vision of terrible beauty, slashing through the foe with his jagged daemonic blades and reveling in the exquisite agony of slaughter.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_marsh_hornets_ror	The Marsh Hornets, led by the Fimm Noble Chulann, are an elite band of Bog Beast Raiders renowned for their lethality and endurance in battle. While most Bog Beast Raiders ride lightly armoured and wielding long glaives, the Marsh Hornets - proud Fianna that they are - don the finest plate their forges can produce, fighting with maces and shields from atop their venomous mounts.\\n\\nUnlike their kin, the Marsh Hornets prefer direct confrontation, crashing into enemy frontlines and holding fast, their heavy armour and sheer strength allowing them to grind the foe into the mire through stubborn persistence and unyielding ferocity.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_moor_hounds_ror	The creatures known as the Hounds of Basker Moor share their origins with the dreaded Nuckelavees - vengeful daemons born of the swamps. Yet unlike the horse-daemons, the Hounds were never summoned intentionally by a Dirach, only bound after their creation.\\n\\nIn the heart of the Wasteland lies the Moor of Basker, where a crumbling manor now sinks into the mire. Long ago, a cruel nobleman lived there, hunting women for sport and releasing his hounds to maim them before delivering the final blow himself. One day he captured a priestess of Rhya, Goddess of Nature, and enacted his vile game once more.\\n\\nBefore dying, the priestess cursed him - that nature would reclaim all he possessed. That night, his own hounds broke free and pursued their master into the bogs he had defiled, dragging him down and devouring him. By dawn, his manor was swallowed by the swamp. From that curse, the Hounds of Basker Moor were born - flayed, horned abominations doomed to hunt all who dare trespass upon the cursed moor.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_long_descr_elo_fenbeast	Fenbeasts are hulking, humanoid constructs formed from the mud, rotting timber, and drowned remains of the swamps. Their bodies are animated by a shard of Ogham Stone embedded within their core, and the trapped souls of those who perished in the fens lend them terrible power.\\n\\nMindless and unfeeling, Fenbeasts obey their summoner’s will until destroyed - at which point they collapse into sludge and decaying matter. Both the Truthsayers and Druids of Albion and the Dark Emissaries of the Citadel of Lead employ them as mercenaries beyond Albion’s shores, where these uncanny monsters serve as brutally effective, if deeply unsettling, shock troops.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_balefiend	A millennia ago, amphibious humanoids known as the Fimir were favoured by the Chaos Gods. Then, as the Gods turned their attentions to the more vibrant and amusing race of man, the Fimir were abandoned. Having since existed in reclusion, they now have a common cause with the Norscan tribes, doing the bidding of the Ruinous Powers as way of regaining their favour. Their mysterious Balefiends wield a powerful magic that appears crude and ritualistic to outsiders, but is incredibly potent. They spend prolonged periods away from the swamps, harvesting power from daemons to destabilise the barrier between the mortal world and the Realm of Chaos.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_wh_dlc08_unit_long_text_nor_fimir_warriors	With a single eye atop a fanged snout, and deathly yellow-grey flesh that can shrug off blows that would kill a mortal man outright, the amphibious humanoid monsters known as the Fimir are horrific living legends. Their origins are unknown to most, but a millennium ago they were roaring the praises of the Dark Gods as they despoiled the lands of men living in the area that would later become the Empire. Then, one day, the Gods abandoned them in favour of man. Despite hating mankind, the Fimir have a common cause with the Norscan tribes, as they both crave the attention of the Dark Gods, but even so, it is an uneasy and fractious alliance.	false
unit_description_historical_texts_text_ovn_unit_long_text_fim_bog_octopus_0	Most octopuses are harmless, even graceful creatures of the seas. The Bog Octopus, however, is a nightmare born of the mire. It resembles an enormous octopus with eight powerful tentacles, bulbous eyes, and slick green flesh - but the similarity ends there.\\n\\nThese beasts dwell in the cold, stinking bogs of the Old World, spending their lives squelching through the mud and quagmires, surfacing only to seize and devour anything unfortunate enough to pass nearby. Living in such dense waters, they possess immense strength; once caught in their grasp, few creatures can escape the crushing power of their coils.	true
unit_description_historical_texts_text_fim_cha_daemon_octopus_kroll	Kroll, the Ancient Evil, All-Mother, and Matriarch of the Bog Octopuses, is one of the demi-gods of the Fimir - Daemon Princes aligned to none of the four Chaos Gods. Kroll is a terrible beast that has plagued the world’s bogs and marshes since long before the arrival of the Old Ones, arrogantly claiming all swamps as her domain. Much larger than her children, crimson in hue and armed with a dreadful beak, she has gathered countless trinkets, weapons, and magical relics from those who have tried and failed to slay her. To think of Kroll as a mindless monster is a fatal mistake - she is a being of great intelligence and cunning. Worshipped at all levels of Fimir society, she is revered for different reasons by each caste: the Shearl admire her nesting craft, the Fimm her strength and deadly arms, and the Meargh her cunning. Equally at home in salt water as in fresh, she is respected by both coastal and inland Fimir alike.	true
