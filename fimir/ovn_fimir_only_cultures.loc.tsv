cultures_frontend_description_ovn_fimir	The Fimir are cyclopean amphibious humanoid creatures who wander the northern and western Old World's marshes, bogs, and dreary meadows. Their fortresses are ominous, jagged mounds of rock, crudely fashioned in the style of more sophisticated cultures' castles. Outsiders rarely come across these towns because they are shrouded in dense mist, a miasma created magically by the Fimir to conceal their strongholds from inquisitive eyes but also themselves from the harsh glare of the sun. Once the favourite of the Ruinous Powers, their capricious masters soon abandone them for a new, more interesting race; Mankind. Ever since, the Fimir have sought to regain the favour of their former gods. Some of them also worship a god known as Balor of the Dead-Deailng Eye, said to be the mythical progenitor of the race. They are divided in four castes, the lowly Shearl, the warlike Fimm, the sorcerous Dirach and the Meargh, leaders and only females of the Fimir. The malign Fimir go to war in smaller armies than the other races, more adept at acting as shock raiding forces to quickly assault settlements and overwhelm enemy garrisons, always accompanied by a dense magical mist to which they will retreat after a raid, be it in victory or defeat. The Boglars—swamp cousins to the Gnoblar race-- and the smaller Shearl Caste Fimir act as chaff and skirmishers, while the warriors of the Fimm Caste perform the duties of heavily armoured, monstrous shock troops. They also bring many terrible creatures from their cursed bogs, from the dull-witted Mistmor to the crazed abominations that are the Daemonomaniacs. The Fimir are not known for their prowess in ranged combat. As such, they field little in the way of ranged warriors, with javelins and the occasional magical support as their only missile support.	false
